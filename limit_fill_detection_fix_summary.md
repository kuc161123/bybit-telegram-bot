Changes made:
1. Fixed limit fill alert condition to trigger for ALL fills, not just <50%
2. Ensured position size increases always trigger order adjustments
3. Added comments for clarity

Key improvement:
- OLD: Only sent alerts for fills under 50%
- NEW: Sends alerts for ANY limit fill

This fix ensures:
- All limit order fills generate alerts
- TP/SL orders are properly adjusted for partial fills
- No more missed alerts for large limit fills
