# GGShot Accuracy Improvements Summary

## Current Issues

Based on the test results, the GGShot system is having these accuracy issues:

### 1. **Incorrect Value Extraction**
- Entry 1 was actually "1.8950" but extracted as "1.8950" (correct) in pass 1
- TP1 was "1.8500" but extracted as "1.8600" (wrong)
- Values are being misread or confused

### 2. **Missing Values**
- Some limit entries showing as N/A when they exist
- The system might be confusing which line corresponds to which value

### 3. **Order Confusion**
- In pass 2, it extracted entry prices in wrong order
- For SHORT trades, entries should be: lowest first (primary), then increasing

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Prompts**
- More specific instructions for mobile screenshots
- Clear guidance on where to look for values
- Emphasis on extracting EXACT numbers as shown

### 2. **Better Image Enhancement**
- Multiple enhancement versions tested
- Picks the version with best contrast
- 6x brightness boost for very dark images
- Threshold-based approach for text extraction

### 3. **Debug Mode**
- Saves enhanced images for inspection
- Shows what the AI is actually analyzing
- Helps identify enhancement issues

## Recommendations for Better Accuracy

### 1. **User Guidelines**
When taking screenshots on mobile:
- Ensure price labels are clearly visible
- Avoid overlapping text
- Use light mode if possible
- Zoom in on the price levels if needed
- Make sure all entry/TP/SL levels are labeled

### 2. **Alternative Approaches**
If accuracy issues persist:
- Use manual entry instead of screenshot
- Take multiple screenshots of different chart sections
- Use tablet/desktop for better resolution
- Ensure good lighting when taking photos of screens

### 3. **Future Enhancements**
- Add OCR preprocessing specific to TradingView mobile UI
- Train custom model on trading screenshots
- Add manual correction step after extraction
- Allow users to verify/edit extracted values

## Testing Your Screenshots

To test with your actual screenshots:
1. Send the screenshot through GGShot as normal
2. Check the bot logs for extraction details
3. Look at debug_enhanced_*.png files to see processing
4. Report any consistent extraction errors

The system now has better prompts and enhancement, but mobile screenshots remain challenging due to:
- Small text size
- Dark backgrounds
- Overlapping elements
- Variable UI layouts
