# Alert and Breakeven Fix Summary

## Date: July 9, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Missing Alerts
- **Issue**: Not receiving alerts for TP hits, SL movements, limit order cancellations, or breakeven moves
- **Root Cause**: Alert functions were checking for `chat_id` and skipping if missing. Mirror monitors didn't have `chat_id` set.
- **Fix**: Added `_find_chat_id_for_position` helper that searches pickle data to find the appropriate chat_id

### Problem 2: SL Not Moving to Breakeven and Quantity Issues
- **Issue**: After TP1 hit (85% filled), SL was not moving to breakeven and quantities didn't match remaining position
- **Root Cause**: Missing alert calls and SL quantity calculation issues
- **Fix**: 
  - Ensured breakeven alerts are sent when SL moves
  - Fixed SL quantity to only adjust after TP1 hits
  - Before TP1: SL covers 100% of target position (including unfilled limits)
  - After TP1: SL covers only the remaining position size

### Problem 3: Dashboard Performance
- **Issue**: Dashboard UI interactions were very slow
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive performance improvements:
  - Intelligent caching with TTL
  - Debouncing for rapid clicks  
  - Rate limiting for API calls
  - Batch processing for operations
  - Connection pooling
  - Optimized pickle operations

### Problem 4: Missing Import Error
- **Issue**: NameError - `get_all_open_orders` not defined in trader.py
- **Fix**: Added missing import to trader.py

## Files Modified

### 1. `execution/enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py`
- Added `_find_chat_id_for_position` helper method
- Updated all alert functions to find chat_id when missing
- Added alert for limit order cancellation
- Fixed SL quantity adjustment logic
- Ensured breakeven alerts are properly sent
- Fixed SL to only adjust after TP1 hits

### 2. `execution/trader.py`
- Added missing import: `get_all_open_orders` from clients.bybit_helpers

### 3. `dashboard/generator_v2.py`
- Added caching decorators
- Optimized expensive operations

### 4. `dashboard/keyboards_v2.py`  
- Added button text caching
- Optimized keyboard generation

### 5. `handlers/callbacks_enhanced.py`
- Added refresh debouncing
- Prevented rapid refresh clicks

### 6. `utils/pickle_lock.py`
- Optimized pickle protocol

### 7. New Files Created:
- `utils/dashboard_performance.py` - Performance utilities
- `utils/connection_pool.py` - Connection pooling

## Key Changes Summary

### Alert System
1. **Chat ID Resolution**: Alerts now search for chat_id in pickle data if not in monitor
2. **Alert Coverage**: All events now send alerts:
   - TP hits (TP1, TP2, TP3, TP4)
   - Limit order fills
   - Limit order cancellations after TP1
   - SL moved to breakeven
   - Position closed
3. **Mirror Support**: Both main and mirror accounts send alerts

### Breakeven Logic
1. **TP1 Trigger**: When 85% of position is filled, breakeven logic triggers
2. **SL Movement**: SL moves to entry price + fees + safety margin
3. **Limit Cleanup**: Unfilled limit orders are cancelled after TP1
4. **Quantity Adjustment**: 
   - Before TP1: SL = 100% of target position
   - After TP1: SL = actual remaining position size

### Performance Improvements
1. **Caching**: 30-second TTL cache for expensive operations
2. **Debouncing**: 2-second cooldown on refresh
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API overload
4. **Batch Processing**: Groups operations for efficiency
5. **Connection Pooling**: Reuses API connections

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open a new conservative position
- [ ] Verify limit order fill alerts are sent
- [ ] Wait for TP1 to hit (85% fill)
- [ ] Verify TP1 hit alert is sent
- [ ] Verify limit order cancellation alert is sent
- [ ] Verify SL moved to breakeven alert is sent
- [ ] Verify SL quantity matches remaining 15% of position
- [ ] Test subsequent TP hits (TP2, TP3, TP4)
- [ ] Verify mirror account receives all alerts
- [ ] Test dashboard refresh performance
- [ ] Verify no rapid refresh allowed (2s cooldown)

## Important Notes

1. **Restart Required**: Bot must be restarted for changes to take effect
2. **Backward Compatible**: Changes maintain compatibility with existing positions
3. **Mirror Sync**: Mirror accounts operate independently but receive same alerts
4. **Performance**: Dashboard should feel significantly more responsive

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Apply all fixes
python3 fix_alerts_and_breakeven.py
python3 fix_sl_quantity_after_tp1.py  
python3 fix_missing_breakeven_alert.py
python3 fix_missing_import.py

# Restart the bot
./scripts/shell/run_main.sh
```

## Monitoring

After restart, monitor logs for:
- "Found chat_id" messages when alerts trigger
- "SL moved to breakeven" confirmations
- "Limit order cleanup" messages after TP1
- Performance improvement metrics in dashboard operations
