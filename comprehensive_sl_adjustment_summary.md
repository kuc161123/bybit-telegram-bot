# Comprehensive SL Adjustment & Alert System Summary

## Date: 2025-07-10

### Issues Fixed

1. **Alert Delivery Problem** ✅
   - **Issue**: Alerts weren't being sent when limit orders filled or TPs hit
   - **Root Cause**: 23 monitors missing chat_id parameter
   - **Fix Applied**: Added chat_id 5634913742 to all orphaned monitors
   - **Result**: All alerts now working correctly

2. **Missing Mirror Monitors** ✅
   - **Issue**: Only 33 monitors instead of expected 36 (18 main + 18 mirror)
   - **Missing**: ARKMUSDT, INJUSDT, NKNUSDT mirror monitors
   - **Fix Applied**: Created missing monitors with estimated 33% sizing
   - **Result**: All 36 monitors now active

3. **SL Quantity Adjustment** ✅
   - **Issue**: SL quantity not adjusting correctly after TP hits
   - **Root Cause**: Using basic adjustment instead of enhanced method
   - **Fix Applied**: Patched to use `_adjust_sl_quantity_enhanced()` throughout
   - **Result**: SL quantities now properly adjust after each TP

4. **Syntax Error** ✅
   - **Issue**: F-string expression cannot include backslash
   - **Fix Applied**: Extracted dictionary values to variables first
   - **Result**: Code now executes without syntax errors

### Complete Flow Now Working

1. **Order Entry**
   - Conservative: Places 3 limit orders + initial TP/SL
   - Fast: Places market order + TP/SL
   - ✅ Alert sent: "POSITION OPENED"

2. **Limit Order Fills** (Conservative only)
   - Each limit fill increases position size
   - ✅ Alert sent: "LIMIT ORDER FILLED"

3. **TP1 Hit (85%)**
   - Takes 85% profit
   - Cancels remaining limit orders
   - Moves SL to breakeven price
   - Adjusts SL quantity to 15% of original
   - ✅ Alerts sent:
     - "TP1 HIT - PROFIT TAKEN!"
     - "Limit Orders Cleaned Up"
     - "STOP LOSS MOVED TO BREAKEVEN"

4. **Subsequent TP Hits (5% each)**
   - TP2: SL adjusts to 10% of original
   - TP3: SL adjusts to 5% of original
   - TP4: Position closes completely
   - ✅ Alert sent for each: "TP2/3/4 HIT"

5. **SL Hit**
   - Closes remaining position
   - ✅ Alert sent: "STOP LOSS HIT"

### Alert Types You'll Receive

1. **Position Opened** - When trade is initiated
2. **Limit Order Filled** - Each limit order fill (conservative)
3. **TP1 Hit - Profit Taken!** - With breakeven info
4. **Limit Orders Cleaned Up** - Shows cancelled orders
5. **Stop Loss Moved to Breakeven** - Confirmation
