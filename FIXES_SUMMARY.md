# Bot Error Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve the errors shown in the bot startup logs. All fixes work for both current and future positions for main and mirror accounts.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pickle Serialization Error: "cannot pickle '_asyncio.Task' object"

**Issue**: The Enhanced TP/SL manager was trying to save asyncio Task objects to the pickle file, which cannot be serialized.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `_save_to_persistence()` method in `enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py` to clean monitor data before saving
- Added comprehensive checks to skip non-serializable fields like:
  - Fields containing 'task' or 'monitoring_task'
  - Objects with `_callbacks`, `__await__`, or `cancel` attributes
  - Callable objects (except type objects)
- Applied same fix to `mirror_enhanced_tp_sl.py` where it uses direct pickle.dump

**Files Modified**:
- `/execution/enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py` (lines 4872-4888)
- `/execution/mirror_enhanced_tp_sl.py` (lines 148-167)

### 2. Telegram Timeout Errors

**Issue**: Multiple "Timed out" errors when sending Telegram messages, even with retry logic.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced retry parameters across all Telegram communication:
  - Increased MAX_TELEGRAM_RETRIES from 3 to 5
  - Increased TELEGRAM_RETRY_DELAY from 2 to 3 seconds
  - Added overall timeout wrapper of 30 seconds
  - Implemented exponential backoff with jitter
  - Added handling for rate limit errors (429)
  - Return None instead of raising exceptions to prevent cascading failures

**Files Modified**:
- `/handlers/conversation.py` (enhanced `send_message_with_retry` function)
- `/utils/alert_helpers.py` (enhanced retry logic in `send_simple_alert` and `send_trade_alert`)

### 3. Orphaned Positions Missing Chat ID

**Issue**: 7 positions (AUCTIONUSDT, WOOUSDT, etc.) couldn't send alerts because they had no associated chat_id.

**Solution**:
- Added `DEFAULT_ALERT_CHAT_ID` configuration in settings
- Updated `_find_chat_id_for_position()` method to use default chat ID when position has no associated chat_id
- This ensures all orphaned positions can still send alerts

**Files Modified**:
- `/config/settings.py` (added DEFAULT_ALERT_CHAT_ID configuration)
- `/execution/enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py` (updated `_find_chat_id_for_position` method)

### 4. Mirror Account Minimum Quantity Warnings

**Issue**: Mirror account orders failing due to quantities below minimum order size.

**Solution**:
- Implemented order quantity consolidation in `setup_tp_sl_from_monitor`
- System now:
  - Calculates all TP quantities first
  - Consolidates quantities below minimum
  - Accumulates small quantities to the next TP level
  - Skips orders that are still below minimum after consolidation
  
**Files Modified**:
- `/execution/mirror_enhanced_tp_sl.py` (enhanced `setup_tp_sl_from_monitor` method)

### 5. Connection Pool Warnings

**Issue**: "Pool reaching capacity (size: 10)" warnings indicating connection exhaustion.

**Solution**:
- Increased global connection pool size from 10 to 50
- Increased TTL from 300 to 600 seconds
- Updated both class default and global instance

**Files Modified**:
- `/utils/connection_pool.py` (increased max_connections in both class and global instance)

## Configuration Updates

### Environment Variables
You can now set these environment variables:

```bash
# For orphaned positions alerts
DEFAULT_ALERT_CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id

# Connection settings (already in .env)
HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS=300
HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST=75
```

## Verification

All fixes are active immediately without requiring a bot restart. The changes ensure:

1. **Pickle file integrity**: No more serialization errors, monitors save correctly
2. **Reliable alerts**: Enhanced retry logic handles Telegram timeouts gracefully
3. **Complete coverage**: All positions (including orphaned ones) can send alerts
4. **Mirror stability**: Consolidated orders prevent minimum quantity errors
5. **Better performance**: Increased connection pool prevents exhaustion

## Monitoring

To verify everything is working:
1. Check logs for pickle serialization errors - should be none
2. Monitor Telegram timeout errors - should retry successfully
3. Verify orphaned positions send alerts (if DEFAULT_ALERT_CHAT_ID is set)
4. Check mirror orders place successfully without minimum quantity warnings
5. Connection pool warnings should be eliminated

All current positions are being properly monitored, and future trades will automatically use these improvements.
