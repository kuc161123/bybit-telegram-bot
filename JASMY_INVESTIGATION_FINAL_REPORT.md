# JASMY TP1 Investigation - Final Report

## Date: January 13, 2025

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive investigation and analysis, I've discovered that **JASMYUSDT has NOT actually hit TP1**. The monitoring system is working correctly.

## Key Findings

### 1. JASMY Current Status
- **Main Account**: 61.7% filled (56,068 out of 90,920)
- **Mirror Account**: 61.7% filled (18,613 out of 30,182)
- **TP1 Requirement**: 85% of position must be filled
- **Conclusion**: TP1 has NOT been hit (only 61.7% < 85%)

### 2. What Actually Happened

#### Initial Misunderstanding
1. When the bot was shut down during the fast approach cleanup, positions continued to partially fill on the exchange
2. Our initial recovery scripts incorrectly marked ALL positions as having ALL TPs filled
3. This caused positions to be marked as "POSITION_CLOSED" when they were still open

#### The Corrections Applied
1. **First Fix**: Synced monitor data with exchange positions
2. **Second Fix**: Changed phase from POSITION_CLOSED to PROFIT_TAKING
3. **Final Fix**: Accurately calculated which TPs were actually filled based on percentages

### 3. Current Position Status

#### Positions with NO TP hits yet:
- **JASMYUSDT**: 61.7% filled (needs 84% for TP1)
- **ONTUSDT**: 66.7% filled
- **SNXUSDT**: 66.7% filled  
- **NTRNUSDT**: 33.3% filled
- **SEIUSDT**: 33.4% filled
- **PENDLEUSDT**: ~34% filled
- **SOLUSDT**: 67% filled

#### Positions with TP1, TP2, TP3 hit (95%+ filled):
- **BIGTIMEUSDT**: 96.7% filled
- **NEARUSDT**: 95.0% filled
- **INJUSDT**: 95.0% filled
- **BELUSDT**: 96.6% filled

## Why No Alert Was Sent for JASMY

**JASMY has not reached the TP1 threshold of 85%**. The monitoring system correctly detected that only 61.7% was filled, which is below the TP1 requirement. Therefore:

1. ✅ No alert was sent (correct behavior)
2. ✅ Limit orders were not cancelled (correct behavior)
3. ✅ SL was not moved to breakeven (correct behavior)
4. ✅ TPs were not rebalanced (correct behavior)

## Monitor System Status

After all corrections:
- ✅ All monitors now show correct phase (PROFIT_TAKING for open positions)
- ✅ TP calculations are accurate based on actual fill percentages
- ✅ No positions are incorrectly marked as closed
- ✅ Monitoring will continue for all open positions

## Conservative Approach TP Distribution

For reference, the conservative approach uses:
- **TP1**: 85% of position
- **TP2**: 5% of position (cumulative 90%)
- **TP3**: 5% of position (cumulative 95%)
- **TP4**: 5% of position (cumulative 100%)

## Conclusion

The Enhanced TP/SL manager is working correctly. JASMYUSDT has not hit TP1 because only 61.7% of the position has been filled, which is below the 85% threshold required for TP1.

When JASMY reaches 85% filled (approximately 77,282 JASMY), then:
1. TP1 alert will be sent
2. Limit orders will be cancelled (if enabled)
3. SL will move to breakeven
4. Remaining TPs will be rebalanced

## Action Required

**Simply restart the bot**. The monitoring system will:
- Continue monitoring all open positions
- Detect when JASMY (or any position) reaches TP thresholds
- Execute all appropriate actions when TPs are hit
- Send alerts for all future TP fills

The system is functioning as designed - it just hasn't detected TP1 for JASMY because TP1 hasn't actually been reached yet.
