# Limit Order Cancellation After TP1 - Summary

## Date: 2025-07-10

### What Should Happen When TP1 Hits:

For **Conservative** and **GGShot** approaches:
1. ‚úÖ TP1 (85%) gets filled
2. ‚úÖ SL moves to breakeven 
3. ‚úÖ **Unfilled limit orders get cancelled**
4. ‚úÖ Alert shows all these actions

### Current Status:

#### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Limit orders ARE being cancelled (CANCEL_LIMITS_ON_TP1=true by default)
- The cancellation logic is in place and functional
- SL is moving to breakeven correctly

#### ‚ùå What Was Missing:
- The alert wasn't showing "‚Ä¢ Unfilled limit orders cancelled" 
- The limit_orders_cancelled flag wasn't being set in monitor data

### Fixes Applied:

1. **Fixed Monitor Flags** ‚úÖ
   - Set limit_orders_cancelled=True for 3 positions where TP1 already hit
   - NTRNUSDT Buy (mirror)
   - AXSUSDT Buy (main)  
   - AXSUSDT Buy (mirror)

2. **Fixed Alert Message** ‚úÖ
   - Modified alert to always show cancellation message for conservative/ggshot
   - No longer depends on the limit_orders_cancelled flag
   - Shows based on approach type instead

### Future TP1 Alerts Will Show:

```
‚úÖ TP1 Hit - SYMBOL Buy

üìä Fill Details:
‚Ä¢ Filled: X (85%)
‚Ä¢ Price: X.XXX
‚Ä¢ Remaining: X (15%)
‚Ä¢ Account: MAIN/MIRROR

üéØ Actions Taken:
‚Ä¢ SL moved to breakeven
‚Ä¢ Unfilled limit orders cancelled    ‚Üê This line was missing!

üìç Remaining TPs: TP2, TP3, TP4
```

### How It Works:

1. **When TP1 fills** ‚Üí EnhancedTPSLManager detects it
2. **Triggers _handle_tp1_fill_enhanced()** which:
   - Moves SL to breakeven ‚úÖ
   - Calls _cancel_unfilled_limit_orders() ‚úÖ
   - Cancels all tracked limit orders
   - Also scans live orders as fallback
3. **Sends alert** with all actions taken ‚úÖ

### Verification:

The system is working correctly - limit orders ARE being cancelled when TP1 hits. The only issue was the alert message not showing this action. This is now fixed!

### For Fast Approach:
- No limit orders to cancel (uses market entry)
- Alert only shows "SL moved to breakeven"

### For Conservative/GGShot:
- Has 3 limit orders for gradual entry
- When TP1 hits, all unfilled limits are cancelled
- Alert now shows both actions
