# Backup Frequency Reduction - Implementation Summary

## Date: January 13, 2025

## Issue
The bot was creating backups every 1-2 seconds, causing:
- Excessive disk I/O
- Performance degradation
- Rapid disk space consumption

## Root Causes Identified

1. **pickle_lock.py**: The `safe_save()` method was creating a backup on EVERY save operation regardless of interval settings
2. **enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py**: Called `_save_to_persistence()` at the end of EVERY monitoring cycle (every 2-5 seconds for critical positions)
3. **robust_persistence.py**: Had correct interval settings but they weren't being enforced at all levels

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed pickle_lock.py
- **File**: `/Users/lualakol/bybit-telegram-bot/utils/pickle_lock.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `BACKUP_INTERVAL` from 300 to 900 seconds (15 minutes)
  - Added time-based checking in `safe_save()` method
  - Now respects backup interval and only creates backups when interval has elapsed

```python
# Before: Created backup on every save
if os.path.exists(self.filepath):
    backup_path = f"{self.filepath}.backup"
    shutil.copy2(self.filepath, backup_path)

# After: Checks interval before creating backup
if os.path.exists(self.filepath):
    current_time = time.time()
    if self.filepath not in LAST_BACKUP_TIME or \
       current_time - LAST_BACKUP_TIME[self.filepath] >= BACKUP_INTERVAL:
        backup_path = f"{self.filepath}.backup"
        shutil.copy2(self.filepath, backup_path)
        LAST_BACKUP_TIME[self.filepath] = current_time
```

### 2. Optimized enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py
- **File**: `/Users/lualakol/bybit-telegram-bot/execution/enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Added persistence timing control in `__init__` method
  - Modified `_save_to_persistence()` to support time-based throttling
  - Added `force` parameter for critical operations
  - Implemented delayed save mechanism for non-critical updates

```python
# Added to __init__:
self.last_persistence_save = 0
self.persistence_interval = 30  # Save at most every 30 seconds
self.pending_persistence_save = False

# Modified _save_to_persistence to check time:
if not force and current_time - self.last_persistence_save < self.persistence_interval:
    # Schedule delayed save instead
```

### 3. Critical Operations Still Save Immediately
- New monitor creation: `await self._save_to_persistence(force=True)`
- Position closure/monitor deletion: `await self._save_to_persistence(force=True)`
- Regular monitoring updates: `await self._save_to_persistence()` (throttled)

## Test Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Backup frequency limited to once every 15 minutes
- ✅ Persistence saves throttled to once every 30 seconds
- ✅ Critical operations (new monitors, deletions) save immediately

## Expected Benefits

1. **Reduced Disk I/O**: From ~1800 backups/hour to 4 backups/hour (99.8% reduction)
2. **Improved Performance**: Less time spent on I/O operations
3. **Disk Space Savings**: Significantly reduced backup accumulation
4. **Maintained Data Integrity**: Critical operations still save immediately

## How It Works Now

1. **Routine Monitoring** (every 2-5 seconds):
   - Monitor checks position status
   - Updates internal state
   - Persistence save is DEFERRED (max once per 30 seconds)

2. **Critical Operations**:
   - New position/monitor created → Saves IMMEDIATELY
   - Position closed/monitor deleted → Saves IMMEDIATELY
   - These use `force=True` to bypass throttling

3. **Backup Creation**:
   - Only creates backup if 15 minutes have passed since last backup
   - Applies to both pickle_lock.py and robust_persistence.py layers

## No Bot Restart Required

The changes take effect immediately as they modify the behavior of existing objects in memory.
