# Leverage Setting Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
When users select leverage in the bot (e.g., 20x), it wasn't being applied to positions on Bybit. Instead, positions were using whatever leverage was last manually set for that symbol.

## Root Cause
The bot was:
1. Collecting leverage input from users ✅
2. Using leverage to calculate position size ✅  
3. **NOT calling Bybit's setLeverage API** ❌

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `set_symbol_leverage()` function to `clients/bybit_helpers.py`
```python
async def set_symbol_leverage(symbol: str, leverage: int, client=None) -> bool:
    """Set leverage for a symbol before placing orders"""
```

### 2. Added `set_mirror_leverage()` function to `execution/mirror_trader.py`
```python
async def set_mirror_leverage(symbol: str, leverage: int) -> bool:
    """Set leverage for a symbol on the mirror account"""
```

### 3. Updated `execution/trader.py` to call these functions:
- In `execute_fast_market()` - before placing fast approach orders
- In `execute_conservative_approach()` - before placing conservative orders
- Sets leverage on both main and mirror accounts (if mirror trading is enabled)

## How It Works Now

1. User selects leverage in bot UI (e.g., 20x)
2. Bot calls `set_symbol_leverage()` before placing orders
3. If mirror trading is enabled, also calls `set_mirror_leverage()`
4. Positions are created with the user-selected leverage
5. If leverage setting fails, bot logs a warning but continues with trade

## Testing

Run the test script to verify:
```bash
python test_leverage_fix.py
```

## Impact

- ✅ User-selected leverage is now properly applied
- ✅ Works for both Fast and Conservative approaches
- ✅ Works for both main and mirror accounts
- ✅ Backward compatible - continues trading even if leverage setting fails
- ✅ Clear logging of leverage setting success/failure

## Files Modified

1. `/clients/bybit_helpers.py` - Added `set_symbol_leverage()`
2. `/execution/mirror_trader.py` - Added `set_mirror_leverage()`
3. `/execution/trader.py` - Added leverage setting calls before order placement

The fix ensures that leverage selected in the bot UI is actually applied to positions on Bybit.
