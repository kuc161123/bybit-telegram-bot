# Complete Monitoring Setup Guide for Trade Notifications

## Overview
This guide ensures you receive notifications for all order fills (market, limit, TP, SL) for future trades.

## 1. Pre-Trade Setup

### Verify Bot is Running
```bash
# Check if bot is running
ps aux | grep main.py

# If not running, start it:
./run_bot.sh
# or
python main.py
```

### Check Configuration
Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:
```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token
BYBIT_API_KEY=your_api_key
BYBIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
USE_TESTNET=false
```

## 2. Opening Trades for Proper Monitoring

### Method 1: Manual Trade Setup (Recommended)
1. Start trade setup:
   ```
   /trade
   ```

2. Follow the conversation flow:
   - Enter symbol (e.g., GALAUSDT)
   - Choose side (Buy/Sell)
   - Choose approach:
     - **Conservative**: 3 limit orders + 4 TPs + 1 SL
     - **Fast**: 1 market order + 1 TP + 1 SL
   - Enter prices and parameters
   - Confirm execution

### Method 2: GGShot (Screenshot Analysis)
1. Take screenshot of trade setup
2. Send to bot with:
   ```
   /trade
   ```
3. Choose GGShot approach
4. Upload screenshot
5. Verify extracted parameters
6. Execute trade

## 3. Monitoring Features by Approach

### Conservative Approach Notifications
- **Limit Order Fills**: Alert when each limit order fills
- **TP1 Hit (Early)**: Alert if TP1 hits before limits fill (cancels all orders)
- **TP1 Hit (With Fills)**: Alert if TP1 hits after some limits fill (cancels remaining limits)
- **TP2/3/4 Hits**: Individual alerts for each TP
- **SL Hit**: Alert with total loss
- **Position Closed**: Summary with final P&L

### Fast Approach Notifications
- **Market Order Fill**: Immediate execution confirmation
- **TP Hit**: Alert when take profit is reached
- **SL Hit**: Alert when stop loss is triggered
- **Position Closed**: Summary with final P&L

## 4. Monitoring Commands

### Check Active Monitors
```
/dashboard
```
Shows all actively monitored positions

### List All Monitors
```
/list_monitors
```
Detailed list of all monitoring tasks

### Clean Up Stuck Monitors
```
/cleanup_monitors
```
Removes duplicate or stuck monitors

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Notifications
1. Check monitor is active:
   ```
   /dashboard
   ```

2. Verify position exists:
   - Check Bybit app/website
   - Confirm position is open

3. Check bot logs:
   ```
   tail -f trading_bot.log | grep GALAUSDT
   ```

### Issue: Duplicate Notifications
1. Clean up monitors:
   ```
   /cleanup_monitors
   ```

2. Restart specific monitor:
   - Close position manually
   - Re-open through bot

### Issue: Bot Restart Lost Monitoring
After bot restart, existing positions need re-initialization:
1. Bot will auto-detect open positions
2. Creates monitors for bot-placed positions
3. Manual positions won't have limit order tracking

## 6. Best Practices

### For Reliable Notifications
1. **Always use the bot to open positions**
2. **Don't modify orders manually on exchange**
3. **Keep bot running continuously**
4. **Use /dashboard to verify monitoring**

### For Conservative Trades
1. **Set meaningful limit levels** (not too far from market)
2. **Use proper position sizing** (divide margin by 3 for limits)
3. **Set realistic TP levels** (TP1 at 70% is standard)

### For Fast Trades
1. **Ensure TP/SL are at reasonable distances**
2. **Check risk/reward ratio before confirming**
3. **Monitor for slippage on market orders**
