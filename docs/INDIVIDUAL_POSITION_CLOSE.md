# Individual Position Closing Feature

## Overview
This feature allows users to close specific positions individually, along with all their corresponding orders, on both main and mirror accounts. This provides granular control over position management without having to use the emergency close all feature.

## How to Use

1. **Access Position List**
   - Click the "üìã Positions" button in the dashboard
   - Or use the `/list_positions` command

2. **View Positions**
   - Main account positions are shown under "üè¶ MAIN ACCOUNT"
   - Mirror account positions (if enabled) are shown under "üîÑ MIRROR ACCOUNT"
   - Each position displays:
     - Symbol and side (Buy/Sell)
     - Size and average entry price
     - Current mark price and leverage
     - Unrealized P&L with percentage

3. **Close a Position**
   - Each position has a "‚ùå Close [SYMBOL]" button
   - Mirror positions show "‚ùå Close [SYMBOL] (Mirror)"
   - Click the button for the position you want to close

4. **Confirm Closure**
   - A confirmation screen appears showing:
     - Full position details
     - Current P&L (profit/loss)
     - Warning that all orders will be cancelled
   - Click "‚úÖ YES, CLOSE [SYMBOL]" to confirm
   - Or click "‚ùå Cancel" to abort

5. **Execution**
   - The bot will:
     1. Cancel ALL orders for that symbol (TP, SL, limit orders)
     2. Close the position at market price
   - A summary shows the results

## Safety Features

- **Two-Step Confirmation**: Prevents accidental closures
- **P&L Display**: Shows current profit/loss before closing
- **Clear Account Labels**: Clearly indicates which account (main/mirror)
- **Order Warning**: Explicitly states all orders will be cancelled
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors
