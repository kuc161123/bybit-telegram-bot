### 1. Conservative Rebalancing Alerts

All rebalancing events now send detailed alerts to the main account:

#### A. Limit Fill Rebalancing
- **Trigger**: When limit orders fill
- **Alert Shows**:
  - Number of limits filled (e.g., 2/3)
  - New position size
  - Entry and current prices
  - New TP distribution (85/5/5/5)
  - New quantities for each TP and SL
  - List of cancelled and new orders

#### B. Position Merge Rebalancing

- **Alert Shows**:
  - Merged position size
  - Entry and current prices
  - Updated TP/SL quantities
  - Orders that were cancelled and recreated

#### C. Take Profit Hit Rebalancing (NEW)
- **Trigger**: When any TP (1-4) is hit
- **Alert Shows**:
  - Which TP was hit (e.g., "TP2 Hit - 2 TPs Remaining")
  - Current position size after TP hit
  - Entry and current prices
  - New equal distribution percentages
  - Updated quantities for remaining TPs
  - Which TPs have already been hit (marked as "hit")
  - Orders cancelled and replaced

### 2. Stop Loss Movement Alerts

When TP1 is hit and SL moves to breakeven:

#### A. TP1 Early Hit (Before Limits Fill)
- Shows all orders cancelled
- Includes new SL price at breakeven + fees
- Formatted with clear visual hierarchy

#### B. TP1 Hit With Fills
- Shows how many limits were filled
- Confirms remaining TPs stay active
- Includes new SL price at breakeven + fees

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Information**: Every rebalancing shows position size, prices, and order changes
2. **Dynamic Distribution**: Shows standard (85/5/5/5) or equal distribution based on remaining TPs
3. **Visual Clarity**: Uses emojis and formatting for easy reading
4. **Price Context**: Always includes entry and current prices for P&L context
5. **Order Tracking**: Lists all cancelled and new orders for transparency

## Mirror Account Behavior

- Mirror account rebalancing occurs silently (no alerts)
- All rebalancing logic works identically for mirror accounts
- Only logging is done for mirror operations

## Testing Verification

To verify alerts are working:
```bash
# Check recent rebalancing alerts
grep "Conservative rebalance" trading_bot.log | tail -20

# Check TP hit rebalancing
grep "TP.*hit.*rebalance" trading_bot.log | tail -20

# Check SL movement alerts
grep "SL moved to breakeven" trading_bot.log | tail -20
```
