# Bybit Telegram Bot Diagnostic Report

**Date**: June 22, 2025  
**Time**: 10:38 AM

## Summary

A comprehensive diagnostic check was performed on the Bybit Telegram Bot. The main issue identified was **duplicate monitors** for active positions, which has been successfully resolved.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Monitor Issue ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Each position (BTCUSDT and TRBUSDT) had 4 monitors instead of the expected 1-2.
- BTCUSDT: 4 monitors (2 fast, 2 conservative) across 2 chat IDs
- TRBUSDT: 4 monitors (2 fast, 2 conservative) across 2 chat IDs

**Root Cause**: The monitor restoration logic was creating duplicate monitors during bot restarts, not properly checking for existing monitors before creating new ones.

**Solution Applied**: 
- Created and ran `cleanup_monitors.py` script
- Removed 6 duplicate monitors
- Kept only the correct conservative approach monitors matching the actual trading approach
- Final state: 2 monitors (1 per position)

- **Python Version**: 3.9.6
- **Virtual Environment**: Active
- **Required Variables**: All present (TELEGRAM_TOKEN, BYBIT_API_KEY, BYBIT_API_SECRET)
