**Date:** 2025-06-20 09:29:21 EAT  
**Git Commit:** df51888 (Revert dashboard to v5.0 (from ultra feature-rich v6.0))  
**Status:** FULLY OPERATIONAL - 24 positions being monitored successfully

## Summary
This checkpoint represents a fully stable and working configuration of the Bybit Telegram Trading Bot. All features are operational, including position monitoring, trade execution, and AI integration.

## Key Metrics at Checkpoint
- **Active Positions:** 24 (1 BOT managed + 23 EXTERNAL)
- **Log File Size:** 431MB (with rotation configured)
- **HTTP Connections:** 300 total, 75 per host
- **Monitor Interval:** 10 seconds
- **All buttons and menus:** Working correctly

## Configuration Changes Applied
1. **Log Rotation Added** (config/settings.py):
   - Max file size: 100MB
   - Backup count: 5
   - Prevents disk space issues

2. **Connection Pool Increased** (config/settings.py):
   - HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS: 300 (from 200)
   - HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST: 75 (from 50)
   - Fixes "connection pool full" warnings

## Critical File Versions

### config/settings.py

# Line 36-38: Enhanced HTTP configuration
HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS = int(os.getenv("HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS", "300"))
HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST = int(os.getenv("HTTP_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOST", "75"))

# Lines 179-191: Log rotation configuration
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler
file_handler = RotatingFileHandler(
    'trading_bot.log', 
    maxBytes=100*1024*1024,  # 100MB max size
    backupCount=5,  # Keep 5 backup files

## File Integrity Check
Key files to verify:
- config/settings.py - Has log rotation and increased connection limits
- main.py - Primary entry point
- requirements.txt - All dependencies listed
- handlers/callbacks.py - All button handlers implemented
- execution/monitor.py - Position monitoring logic
- trading_bot.log - Should not exceed 100MB with rotation

## Notes
- Bot has been running continuously without crashes
- All UI buttons and menus tested and working
- No pending errors or warnings except minor connection pool messages
- Performance is optimal with current settings
