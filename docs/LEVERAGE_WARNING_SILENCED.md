# Leverage Warning Silenced

## Summary
The leverage warning (error code 110043) has been successfully silenced. This warning appeared when trying to set leverage that was already set to the requested value.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `clients/bybit_helpers.py`
- Modified `api_call_with_retry()` to handle error 110043 as a success case
- When this error is detected, it returns a success response instead of logging an error
- The function now logs a debug message instead: "Leverage already set correctly"

### 2. Updated `set_symbol_leverage()` in `bybit_helpers.py`
- Added logic to check if the response message is "Leverage already set"
- If so, it logs a debug message instead of an info message

### 3. Updated `execution/trader.py`
- Changed warning messages to debug messages when leverage setting "fails"
- This prevents unnecessary warnings in the logs

### 4. Updated `execution/mirror_trader.py`
- Added specific handling for error code 110043
- Returns success when leverage is already set correctly

## Behavior Before Fix
```
ERROR - API call error (attempt 1/5): leverage not modified (ErrCode: 110043)
ERROR - API call error (attempt 2/5): leverage not modified (ErrCode: 110043)
...
WARNING - ⚠️ Failed to set leverage, continuing with existing leverage
```

## Behavior After Fix
```
INFO - ⚡ Setting leverage for IOTXUSDT to 12x...
DEBUG - Leverage already set correctly (attempt 1/5)
DEBUG - ✅ IOTXUSDT leverage already at 12x
```

## Technical Details
- Error code 110043 from Bybit means "leverage not modified" 
- This occurs when the requested leverage is already set
- It's not actually an error - it's Bybit's way of saying "no change needed"
- The fix treats this as a success case rather than an error

## Testing
Run `python test_leverage_silence.py` to verify the fix is working correctly.
