# GGShot Color Box Recognition Update

## Key Visual Indicators Added

Based on user feedback, the GGShot system now specifically looks for:

### ðŸ”´ RED BOXES = Entry Prices & Take Profits
- Numbers inside small red rectangular backgrounds
- Multiple red boxes indicate multiple entries or TPs
- Position matters:
  - For SHORT trades: Red boxes ABOVE current price = Entries
  - For SHORT trades: Red boxes BELOW entries = Take Profits

### â¬œ GREY BOXES = Stop Loss
- Numbers inside small grey/gray rectangular backgrounds
- Usually only one grey box per trade
- For SHORT trades: Grey box at the TOP
- For LONG trades: Grey box at the BOTTOM

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Updated All Prompts**
- Main prompt now specifically mentions red and grey boxes
- Simple prompt focuses on finding colored boxes
- Numbers-only prompt extracts box color and position

### 2. **Smart Parsing Logic**
- Separates numbers by box color
- Uses color to determine price type
- Position-aware sorting for entries vs TPs

### 3. **Higher Confidence**
- Color-based extraction has 0.9 confidence
- More accurate than guessing from position alone
- Reduces misidentification of price types

## How It Works

1. **Color Detection**
   - AI looks for red boxes first
   - Then finds grey boxes
   - Extracts exact numbers from each

2. **Position Analysis**
   - For SHORT: Higher red boxes = entries, lower = TPs
   - Stop loss identified by grey color, not position

3. **Strategy Detection**
   - 3+ red boxes in entry zone = Conservative
   - Multiple red boxes in TP zone = Multiple targets

## Benefits

- âœ… More accurate price type identification
- âœ… Reduced confusion between entries and TPs  
- âœ… Clear visual indicator for stop loss
- âœ… Works better with dark mobile screenshots

## User Tips

When taking screenshots:
- Ensure colored boxes are visible
- Red boxes should be clearly red (not too dark)
- Grey box for stop loss should be distinguishable
- Avoid filters that change colors significantly

The system will now look specifically for these colored indicators!
