# AI Market Insights Improvements

## Overview
We've significantly enhanced the AI Market Insights section of the trading bot dashboard, transforming it from a simple win-streak based prediction system to a sophisticated AI-powered market analysis tool.

## Previous Implementation Issues
1. **Simplistic confidence calculation**: Just `min(95, win_rate + win_streak * 2)`
2. **Basic momentum detection**: Only based on win/loss streaks
3. **Simple trend detection**: Only based on win rate thresholds
4. **No actual AI integration**: OpenAI client was configured but not used
5. **No market data analysis**: Didn't consider price action, volume, or market conditions
6. **No social sentiment integration**: Social media sentiment was collected but not used
