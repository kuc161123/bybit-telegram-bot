# Conservative-Only Trading Mode Activated

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Conservative Trading is Now the Only Option**
- The bot will automatically select conservative approach for all trades

- Uses 3 limit orders + 4 TPs + 1 SL strategy exclusively

### 2. **All Errors Have Been Fixed**

#### ✅ Fixed: Repeated TP Fill Alerts
- Added duplicate fill detection
- Prevents cumulative percentage from exceeding 100%
- Each TP fill is only processed once

#### ✅ Fixed: Order Cancellation Loops
- Orders that don't exist (error 110001) are immediately marked as complete
- Added 30-second cooldown to prevent repeated cancellation attempts
- Non-existent orders are cached to prevent future attempts

#### ✅ Fixed: "Fast Approach" Messages
- All approach messages now correctly show "Conservative approach"
- TP messages show the appropriate TP level (TP1, TP2, etc.)

#### ✅ Fixed: Monitor Loops for Closed Positions
- Monitors automatically stop when positions are closed
- Position existence is checked before processing fills
- Monitoring tasks are cancelled when positions close
