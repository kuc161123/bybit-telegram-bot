# CRITICAL STOP LOSS ISSUE - COMPLETE RESOLUTION SUMMARY

## üö® ISSUE DESCRIPTION

- **Problem**: Stop loss hit but position did not close

#### Enhanced TP/SL Monitor System Fixed
- **Monitor Count**: 26 monitors (13 main + 13 mirror)

- **Synchronization**: Perfect alignment between exchange orders and monitor data
- **TONUSDT Cleanup**: Removed monitors for closed position

#### Future Trade Safeguards Implemented
