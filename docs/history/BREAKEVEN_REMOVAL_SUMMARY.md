# Stop Loss Breakeven Movement Removal - Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Removed Breakeven Movement Functionality**
- The bot NO LONGER moves stop loss to breakeven when TP1 hits
- Stop loss prices remain at their original trigger prices throughout the trade
- Only the quantities are rebalanced to match the remaining position size

### 2. **Files Modified**

#### execution/monitor.py
- Removed `move_sl_to_breakeven()` function entirely (lines 3457-3568)
- Replaced all 3 calls to `move_sl_to_breakeven()` with calls to `rebalance_sl_quantity_after_tp1()`
- Removed all `sl_moved_to_breakeven` and `sl_breakeven_price` chat_data references
- Updated both main and mirror account handling

#### execution/conservative_rebalancer.py
- Renamed `rebalance_sl_quantity_on_breakeven()` to `rebalance_sl_quantity_after_tp1()`
- Updated function documentation to remove breakeven references
- Updated log messages from "after breakeven move" to "after TP1 hit"
- Added `is_mirror` parameter for mirror account support

#### utils/alert_helpers.py
- Removed breakeven checks in alert formatting functions
- Removed "Stop Loss moved to breakeven + fees" messages
- Set `sl_moved` to always be False

#### execution/trade_messages.py
- Removed `calculate_breakeven()` function
- Removed breakeven display from trade execution messages

### 3. **Current Behavior**

When TP1 hits:
1. TP1 order executes, reducing position size
2. Conservative rebalancer is triggered for remaining TPs
3. SL quantity is rebalanced to match remaining position size
4. All trigger prices remain unchanged (no SL movement)
5. Alerts are sent showing the rebalanced quantities

### 4. **Alerts Still Working**

All alerts continue to function normally:
- TP hit alerts
- SL hit alerts
- Position closed alerts
- Rebalancing alerts (showing new quantities)
- Manual close alerts

The only change is that alerts no longer mention moving SL to breakeven.

### 5. **Both Accounts Supported**

The changes apply to both:
- Main trading account
- Mirror trading account (if configured)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Place a conservative trade with multiple TPs
2. Wait for TP1 to hit
3. Verify that:
   - SL price remains unchanged
   - SL quantity is reduced to match remaining position
   - Alerts show rebalanced quantities
   - No breakeven messages appear

The bot now operates with simplified logic where all orders maintain their original trigger prices throughout the trade lifecycle.
