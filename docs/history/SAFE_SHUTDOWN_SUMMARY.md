## Shutdown Instructions

### To Stop the Bot Process:

1. **Check if bot is running:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep 'python main.py'
   ```

2. **Stop the bot (choose one method):**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the bot
   - Run: `./kill_bot.sh`
   - Run: `pkill -f 'python main.py'`

3. **Verify bot has stopped:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep 'python main.py'
   ```
   Should show no results.

### To Restart the Bot:

```bash
./run_main.sh
```
or
```bash
python main.py
```

## Important Notes

✅ **State Preserved**: All position monitors and configurations have been saved  
✅ **No Duplicates**: When restarting, the bot will recognize existing positions and orders  
✅ **Safe to Restart**: The bot will continue monitoring existing positions without creating duplicate orders  

## Monitor Status

Currently **0 active monitors** were found in the pickle state. When the bot restarts:
- It will automatically scan for open positions
- It will recreate monitors for each active position
- It will recognize existing TP/SL orders and won't create duplicates

## Recommendation

Before restarting the bot:
1. Ensure all positions shown above match your expectations
2. Check that the open order counts are reasonable
3. Verify the backup files were created successfully

The bot is now ready for a safe shutdown and restart without any risk of duplicate orders or lost state.
