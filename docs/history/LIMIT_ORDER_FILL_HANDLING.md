# Limit Order Fill Handling in Enhanced TP/SL System

## Overview
When using the Conservative approach with 3 limit orders, the enhanced TP/SL system dynamically adjusts TP and SL orders as limit orders fill.

## How It Works

### Initial Setup (Order 1 Fills)
1. First order fills (market order): Position size = 62.0
2. Enhanced TP/SL creates orders based on this initial size:
   - TP1 (85%): 52.7 contracts
   - TP2 (5%): 3.1 contracts  
   - TP3 (5%): 3.1 contracts
   - TP4 (5%): 3.1 contracts
   - SL (100%): 62.0 contracts

### When Limit Order 2 Fills
1. Position increases to 124.0 (2x initial)
2. Monitor detects position change
3. System adjusts all orders proportionally:
   - TP1: 52.7 → 105.4 contracts
   - TP2: 3.1 → 6.2 contracts
   - TP3: 3.1 → 6.2 contracts
   - TP4: 3.1 → 6.2 contracts
   - SL: 62.0 → 124.0 contracts
4. Alert sent: "Limit Order Filled!"

### When Limit Order 3 Fills
1. Position increases to 186.0 (3x initial)
2. System adjusts again:
   - TP1: 105.4 → 158.1 contracts (85% of 186)
   - TP2: 6.2 → 9.3 contracts (5% of 186)
   - TP3: 6.2 → 9.3 contracts (5% of 186)
   - TP4: 6.2 → 9.3 contracts (5% of 186)
   - SL: 124.0 → 186.0 contracts
3. Alert sent: "Limit Order Filled!"

## Technical Implementation

### Position Monitoring
- Runs every 12 seconds
- Compares current position size with tracked size
- Detects increases as limit fills

### Order Adjustment Process
1. **Cancel existing orders** - Removes current TP/SL orders
2. **Calculate new quantities** - Scales based on position growth
3. **Place new orders** - Creates orders with updated quantities
4. **Update tracking** - Stores new order IDs and quantities

### Key Features
- **Automatic scaling** - TP/SL quantities always match position
- **Minimum order validation** - Skips orders below $5 value
- **Alert notifications** - Informs when limits fill
- **Error handling** - Continues if individual order fails

## Benefits
1. **Risk Management** - SL always covers full position
2. **Profit Optimization** - TPs scale with position size
3. **Flexibility** - Works with partial fills
4. **Transparency** - Alerts keep you informed

## Example Scenario
Starting with CYBERUSDT at $1.265:
- Order 1 fills: 62 contracts → TP/SL for 62
- Order 2 fills: +62 contracts → TP/SL adjusted to 124
- Order 3 fills: +62 contracts → TP/SL adjusted to 186
- Final position: 186 contracts with properly scaled TP/SL

## Important Notes
- Orders are adjusted automatically - no manual intervention needed
- If an adjustment fails, the system logs the error and continues
- The monitoring continues until the position is closed
- Works for both main and mirror accounts
