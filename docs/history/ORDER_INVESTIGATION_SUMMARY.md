# Order Investigation Summary

## Date: June 30, 2025

## Issues Identified

### 1. Conservative Rebalancer Recreation Loop
**Problem**: The Conservative rebalancer was recreating TP1 orders that had already been executed.

**Root Cause**:
- When TP1 executes (85% of position), the position size reduces to 15%
- The monitor clears `conservative_tps_hit` tracking when position closes
- The rebalancer sees missing TP1 and tries to recreate it
- The recreated TP1 can't execute because position is too small

**Solution**: 
- Check position size vs expected size based on TP distribution
- If position is smaller than expected, assume TPs have executed
- Only recreate TPs if position size matches expected unfilled state

### 2. Order Disappearance
**Investigation Results**:
- Orders are being cancelled with "CancelByUser" status
- Most cancellations are BOT_CONS orders (Conservative approach)
- No evidence of external interference or API issues
- The bot's own logic is causing the cancellations

### 3. Current Position Status
**Main Account**: 16 positions (all Fast approach)
- All positions have TP and SL orders
- No limit orders (as expected for Fast approach)

**Mirror Account**: 16 positions (15 Conservative, 1 Fast)
- Conservative positions have 4 TP orders each
- All have SL orders
- No limit orders detected (they've likely been filled)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fix Conservative Rebalancer (fix_conservative_rebalancer.py)
- Added position size validation before recreating TPs
- Created patch file for conservative_rebalancer.py
- Prevents recreation of already-executed TP orders

### 2. Monitor Restart Configuration (restart_monitors_simple.py)
- Assumes all existing positions have had their limit orders filled
- Only monitors TP/SL orders for existing positions
- New positions will work normally with full tracking
- Created configuration file: monitor_restart_config.json

### 3. Order Recreation Script (recreate_all_orders.py)
- Cancels all existing orders
- Recreates orders based on original trigger prices
- Applies to both main and mirror accounts
- Uses trade history data for accurate recreation

### 4. Comprehensive Investigation Tool (comprehensive_order_investigation.py)
- Monitors order lifecycle events
- Tracks cancellation patterns
- Identifies bot logic issues
- Real-time monitoring capabilities

## Key Findings

1. **All positions are using Conservative approach correctly**
   - Mirror account shows proper 85/5/5/5 TP distribution
   - Main account uses Fast approach (single TP/SL)

2. **No external order cancellations detected**
   - All cancellations are from bot logic
   - "CancelByUser" indicates programmatic cancellation

3. **The core issue is the Conservative rebalancer logic**
   - It doesn't account for already-executed TPs
   - Tries to maintain order count without checking execution status

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate**:
   - Apply the Conservative rebalancer fix
   - Restart monitors with limits-filled assumption
   - Monitor for 24 hours to ensure stability

2. **Short-term**:
   - Implement position size validation in all rebalancing logic
   - Add execution tracking to prevent duplicate orders
   - Enhance logging for order lifecycle events

3. **Long-term**:
   - Refactor Conservative rebalancer to use trade history as source of truth
   - Implement order state tracking independent of chat_data
   - Add automated tests for TP execution scenarios

## Commands to Execute

```bash
# 1. Apply Conservative rebalancer fix
patch -p1 < conservative_rebalancer_fix.patch

# 2. Generate monitor configuration
python restart_monitors_simple.py

# 3. Stop the bot
pkill -f 'python main.py'

# 4. Apply configuration (optional, if using persistence)
python apply_monitor_config.py

# 5. Restart the bot
python main.py

# 6. Monitor for issues
python monitor_tp_recreation.py
```

## Monitoring

Use these scripts to verify the fix:
- `monitor_tp_recreation.py` - Monitors for TP recreation issues
- `comprehensive_order_investigation.py` - Full order lifecycle analysis
- Check logs for "Conservative rebalance" messages

## Success Criteria

1. No TP orders with quantity > position size
2. No recreation of TP orders after execution
3. Stable order count for Conservative positions
4. No "order disappeared" warnings in logs
