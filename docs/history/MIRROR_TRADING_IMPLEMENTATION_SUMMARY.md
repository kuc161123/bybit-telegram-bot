# Mirror Trading Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Bybit Telegram Bot supports mirror trading on a second Bybit account, replicating trades with proportional sizing and full monitoring capabilities.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **Configuration & Setup**
   - Mirror trading enabled via `ENABLE_MIRROR_TRADING` environment variable
   - Separate API credentials: `BYBIT_API_KEY_2` and `BYBIT_API_SECRET_2`
   - Mirror account uses One-Way Mode (simplified from hedge mode)

2. **Order Execution**
   - `mirror_market_order()` - Places market orders on mirror account
   - `mirror_limit_order()` - Places limit orders on mirror account  
   - `mirror_tp_sl_order()` - Places TP/SL orders on mirror account
   - All mirror functions return None on failure to not affect main trading
   - Proper quantity formatting to prevent scientific notation

3. **Enhanced TP/SL System**
   - Full Enhanced TP/SL support via `mirror_enhanced_tp_sl.py`
   - Dashboard monitor creation fixed (creates entries with `_mirror` suffix)
   - Order lifecycle tracking and phase management
   - Breakeven moves synchronized with main account

4. **Position Synchronization**
   - `sync_position_increase_from_main()` - Syncs when main position increases
   - `_trigger_mirror_sync_for_position_increase()` - Triggered on limit fills
   - Proportional order adjustments using cancel-and-replace strategy
   - Phase synchronization (BUILDING ‚Üí PROFIT_TAKING)

5. **Monitoring & Dashboard**
   - Separate monitoring loops for mirror positions
   - Dashboard shows mirror positions separately
   - Monitor counting properly identifies mirror monitors
   - Monitor keys: `{chat_id}_{symbol}_{approach}_mirror`

6. **Error Handling**
   - Circuit breaker pattern for error recovery
   - Independent error handling (mirror failures don't affect main)
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Resource cleanup and memory management

### üìä Key Implementation Details

#### Monitor Key Format
- **Main Account**: `{chat_id}_{symbol}_{approach}`
- **Mirror Account**: `{chat_id}_{symbol}_{approach}_mirror`

#### Position Mode
- Mirror account uses **One-Way Mode** (positionIdx=0)
- Main account can use either One-Way or Hedge Mode

#### Proportional Trading
- Mirror positions can use different sizing (e.g., 50% of main)
- Margin allocation is proportional
- TP/SL orders adjusted based on mirror position size

#### Alert Settings
- Mirror trading alerts are disabled by default
- Can be enabled in `config/settings.py` ALERT_SETTINGS

### üîß Usage

1. **Enable Mirror Trading**
   ```bash
   ENABLE_MIRROR_TRADING=true
   BYBIT_API_KEY_2=your_mirror_api_key
   BYBIT_API_SECRET_2=your_mirror_api_secret
   ```

2. **Trade Execution**
   - When placing trades, mirror orders are automatically created
   - Enhanced TP/SL monitors are set up for both accounts
   - Position changes are synchronized between accounts

3. **Monitoring**
   - View positions: `/positions` shows both main and mirror
   - Dashboard displays separate counts for each account
   - All standard bot commands work with both accounts

### üêõ Known Issues Fixed

1. **Monitor Creation Bug** ‚úÖ
   - Mirror Enhanced TP/SL wasn't creating dashboard entries
   - Fixed in `mirror_enhanced_tp_sl.py` lines 316-333

2. **Monitor Counting** ‚úÖ  
   - Dashboard properly parses monitor keys to identify mirror
   - Shows correct counts for main vs mirror monitors

3. **Position Synchronization** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented full sync when main position changes
   - TP/SL orders adjusted proportionally

### üìù Maintenance Scripts

- `find_missing_monitors_complete.py` - Verify monitor coverage
- `add_missing_enhanced_monitors.py` - Add monitors for existing positions
- `check_current_status.py` - Check overall system status

### üöÄ Future Enhancements

1. **Configurable Mirror Proportion**
   - Allow users to set mirror account percentage (e.g., 25%, 50%, 100%)
   - Per-trade proportion settings

2. **Independent Trading Modes**
   - Allow different approaches for mirror (e.g., main=aggressive, mirror=conservative)
   - Separate risk parameters

3. **Advanced Sync Options**
   - Selective mirroring (only certain symbols)
   - Time-delayed mirroring
   - Reverse mirroring (opposite trades)

## Summary

The mirror trading implementation is fully functional with the Enhanced TP/SL system. It provides complete trade replication with proportional sizing, independent monitoring, and proper error handling. The system ensures that mirror account operations don't interfere with main account trading while maintaining synchronization for position changes.
