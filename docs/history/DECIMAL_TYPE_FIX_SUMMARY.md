# Decimal Type Mismatch Fix Summary

## Issue
The Enhanced TP/SL monitoring system was experiencing repeated errors:
```
ERROR - Error verifying position consistency: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'decimal.Decimal' and 'float'
```

## Root Cause
When monitor data was loaded from persistence (pickle file), numeric fields like `remaining_size` were stored as float values. The code was attempting to perform arithmetic operations between Decimal and float types, which Python doesn't allow.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Immediate Type Mismatch (line 1619)
Changed:
```python
tracked_size = monitor_data.get("remaining_size", Decimal("0"))
```
To:
```python
tracked_size = Decimal(str(monitor_data.get("remaining_size", "0")))
```

### 2. Added Comprehensive Sanitization Method
Created `_sanitize_monitor_data()` method that converts all numeric fields to Decimal:
- entry_price
- position_size
- current_size
- remaining_size
- sl_moved_to_be_price
- original_sl_price
- avg_partial_fill_price
- last_limit_fill_size
- cumulative_fill_size
- Nested fill_tracker values

### 3. Applied Sanitization at Key Points
- When monitors are loaded from persistence in `background_tasks.py`
- At the start of each monitoring cycle in `monitor_and_adjust_orders()`

## Benefits
- Prevents type mismatch errors for all current and future positions
- Works for both main and mirror accounts
- Handles legacy data in persistence files
- Future-proof against similar issues

## Verification
The fix has been tested and verified to:
1. Successfully convert float values to Decimal
2. Allow arithmetic operations between Decimal values
3. Preserve precision for financial calculations

## Recommendation
Restart the bot to apply the fix. The sanitization will automatically handle any existing monitors with float values in the persistence file.
