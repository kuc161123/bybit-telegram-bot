# Enhanced TP/SL System Status

## ‚úÖ Current Status: FULLY INTEGRATED AND ENABLED

### System Components

   - ‚úÖ Created and functional (721 lines)
   - ‚úÖ Replaces conditional orders with direct orders
   - ‚úÖ Active monitoring every 12 seconds
   - ‚úÖ Hedge mode support with position index detection
   - ‚úÖ Alert integration for TP fills, SL hits, breakeven, and closures
   - ‚úÖ Handles partial fills and quantity adjustments

2. **Mirror Enhanced TP/SL** (`execution/mirror_enhanced_tp_sl.py`)
   - ‚úÖ Created and functional (381 lines)
   - ‚úÖ Synchronizes with main account
   - ‚úÖ Proportional order adjustments

   - ‚úÖ **main.py**: Conservative rebalancer disabled when enhanced system is active (lines 1054-1062)
   - ‚úÖ **config/settings.py**: `ENABLE_ENHANCED_TP_SL` setting (default: true)
   - ‚úÖ **.env.example**: Documented the new setting

### Key Features

#### 1. Direct Order Management
- Places limit orders for TPs (not conditional)
- Places stop orders for SL
- No dependency on Bybit's conditional order system

#### 2. Active Monitoring
- Monitors positions every 12 seconds
- Detects fills and adjusts remaining orders
- Implements OCO logic programmatically

#### 3. Hedge Mode Support
- Automatically detects correct position index
- Works with both One-Way and Hedge modes
- Passes positionIdx parameter to all orders

#### 4. Alert System
- TP fill alerts with level indication
- SL hit alerts with loss calculation
- Breakeven alerts when SL moved
- Position closed summaries

#### 5. Quantity Adjustments
- Handles partial limit order fills
- Proportionally adjusts all TP/SL quantities
- Cancels orders that become too small

#### 6. Mirror Trading
- Full mirror account support
- Synchronizes with main position changes
- Independent monitoring loops

### Configuration

```bash
# In .env file
ENABLE_ENHANCED_TP_SL=true  # Enable enhanced system (default)
```

### How It Works

1. **Fast Approach**:
   - Market order for entry
   - Single TP at 100% (limit order)
   - Single SL (stop order)
   - Monitor adjusts SL when TP fills

2. **Conservative Approach**:
   - Limit orders for entry
   - 4 TPs: 85%, 5%, 5%, 5% (limit orders)
   - Single SL for full position (stop order)
   - Monitor adjusts quantities when limit orders partially fill
   - SL moves to breakeven after TP1 (85%) fills

### System Status Checks

1. **Enhanced System Active**:
   - Check logs for: "üöÄ Using enhanced TP/SL system"
   - Conservative rebalancer shows: "‚ÑπÔ∏è Conservative rebalancer disabled"

2. **Monitor Running**:
   - Check logs for: "üîÑ Starting enhanced monitor loop"
   - Position monitors stored in `enhanced_tp_sl_manager.position_monitors`

3. **Order Placement**:
   - TP orders show as regular limit orders (not conditional)
   - SL shows as stop order with triggerPrice

### Benefits Over Conditional Orders

1. **Reliability**: Direct orders are more reliable than conditionals
2. **Flexibility**: Can adjust quantities dynamically
3. **Visibility**: All orders visible in order book
4. **Control**: Programmatic OCO logic more precise
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time position tracking

### Potential Issues Resolved

1. **TP1 closing 0% instead of 85%**: Fixed with direct orders
2. **Infinite error loops**: Eliminated with proper error handling
3. **External order protection**: Only manages BOT_ prefixed orders
4. **Hedge mode errors**: Position index properly detected
5. **Mirror sync issues**: Independent monitoring prevents conflicts
