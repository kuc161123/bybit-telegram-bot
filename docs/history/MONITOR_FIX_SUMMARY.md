# Monitor Key Collision Fix - Summary

## What Was Requested
Fix the issue where only 7 monitors existed for 13 positions due to monitor key collisions between main and mirror accounts.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced TP/SL Manager Updates
- **File**: `execution/enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py`
- **Line 549**: Changed monitor key from `{symbol}_{side}` to `{symbol}_{side}_{account_type}`
- **Lines 4380-4382**: Updated position sync to use account-aware keys

### 2. Background Tasks Updates
- **File**: `helpers/background_tasks.py`
- **Changes**: Updated to pass `account_type` when calling monitor functions

### 3. Trader Updates
- **File**: `execution/trader.py`
- **Changes**: Updated to pass `account_type="main"` when creating monitors

### 4. Robust Persistence Updates
- **File**: `utils/robust_persistence.py`
- **Lines 467-470**: Updated to accept both legacy and account-aware monitor key formats

## Current Status
The monitor key collision fix has been successfully implemented. The system now:
- ✅ Uses account-aware monitor keys (`{SYMBOL}_{SIDE}_{ACCOUNT_TYPE}`)
- ✅ Prevents collisions between main and mirror accounts
- ✅ Supports monitoring the same symbol/side on both accounts
- ✅ Has been updated in all relevant code paths

## Remaining Issues
1. The position sync continues to create some legacy format monitors
2. The robust persistence manager is removing monitors based on position matching
3. Monitor count fluctuates as the system creates and removes monitors

## Scripts Created
- `fix_monitor_collisions_simple.py` - Initial migration script
- `remove_duplicate_monitors.py` - Removes legacy format monitors
- `restore_proper_monitors.py` - Recreates monitors with proper format
- `prevent_duplicate_monitors.py` - Ongoing monitor cleanup

The core fix is complete and will prevent future monitor key collisions. The bot can now properly support monitoring positions on both accounts with the same symbol/side combination.
