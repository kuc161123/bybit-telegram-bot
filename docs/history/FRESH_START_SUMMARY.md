# Fresh Start Summary - Bot Reset Complete

## Date: June 30, 2025

## What Was Done

### 1. Complete Memory Reset
- ✅ All persistence files cleared
- ✅ All trade history reset
- ✅ All monitoring states cleared
- ✅ All logs cleaned
- ✅ Backup created at: `backups/backup_20250630_095042`

### 2. Fixes Applied

#### Conservative Rebalancer Fix
```python
# Added position size validation before recreating TPs
if actual_position_size < (expected_size * size_tolerance):
    return {"success": True, "message": "TPs already executed, no rebalancing needed"}
```

#### Issues Fixed:
1. **TP1 Execution (85% close)** - Will now properly close 85% of position
2. **Limit Order Rebalancing** - Will correctly rebalance when limits fill
3. **Order Recreation Loop** - Prevented by checking position size
4. **Order Disappearance** - Fixed by preventing unnecessary recreations

### 3. Enhanced Trade Logging

The bot now uses `enhanced_trade_logger.py` which captures:

- **Complete Trade Entry**
  - Entry price, size, timestamp
  - All limit orders with prices
  - All TP orders with trigger prices
  - SL order with trigger price
  - Risk management data
  - Account balance and leverage

- **Order Events**
  - Order placements
  - Order modifications
  - Order cancellations
  - Order fills (partial and complete)
  - Rejection reasons

- **Position Updates**
  - Merges with old/new sizes
  - Splits
  - Rebalances with details
  - Closures with final P&L

- **Performance Tracking**
  - Realized P&L
  - Unrealized P&L
  - Max profit/drawdown
  - Fees paid
  - Trade duration

### 4. Fresh Configuration

Created `fresh_start_config.json` with:
```json
{
  "enhanced_logging": true,
  "log_all_orders": true,
  "log_limit_orders": true,
  "comprehensive_tracking": true,
  "track_order_modifications": true,
  "track_cancellations": true,
  "track_rebalances": true
}
```

## How to Start the Bot

```bash
python main.py
```

## What to Expect

1. **Clean Start**
   - Bot starts with no memory of previous trades
   - All monitoring begins fresh
   - No orphaned monitors or orders

2. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Every trade action is logged
   - All limit orders tracked
   - Complete order lifecycle captured
   - JSON format for easy analysis

3. **Fixed Behaviors**
   - TP1 will close exactly 85% of position
   - Limit fills trigger proper rebalancing
   - No order recreation loops
   - Stable order management

4. **Trade History Location**
   - Main file: `data/enhanced_trade_history.json`

## Monitoring the Fixes

To verify everything is working:

1. **Check Trade Logs**
   ```bash
   tail -f data/enhanced_trade_history.json
   ```

2. **Monitor Bot Logs**
   ```bash
   tail -f trading_bot.log
   ```

3. **Verify TP Execution**
   - When TP1 hits, check position reduces by 85%
   - Check logs for "Position size indicates TPs have executed"

4. **Check Order Stability**
   - Orders should remain stable
   - No "order disappeared" warnings
   - No excessive cancellations
