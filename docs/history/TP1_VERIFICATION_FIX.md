# TP1 Execution Verification Fix

## Date: 2025-06-30

### Issue Identified
When TP1 (Take Profit 1) was triggered for Conservative approach positions, the system would:
1. Correctly detect that the TP1 trigger price was reached
2. Cancel remaining limit orders appropriately
3. **BUT** never verify that TP1 actually executed and closed 85% of the position

This could lead to situations where TP1 was "hit" but the position didn't actually reduce by 85%, causing incorrect position tracking and order distributions.

### Root Cause
The verification logic in `tp_execution_verifier.py` was only being called for TP2, TP3, and TP4 in the `check_conservative_other_tp_hits` function. TP1 detection logic existed but lacked the critical execution verification step.

### Fix Implementation

#### 1. Added TP1 Verification for Main Account (monitor.py)
- **Scenario 1**: When TP1 hits before any limit orders fill
  - Added position capture before TP1 detection
  - Added 2-second wait for TP1 execution
  - Added verification call to ensure 85% position closure
  - Added corrective market order placement if verification fails
  - Added user alerts for verification failures
  - Updates position tracking based on actual execution

- **Scenario 2**: When TP1 hits after some limit orders fill
  - Same verification logic as Scenario 1
  - Triggers Conservative rebalancing after verification
  - Maintains TP2/3/4 orders with proper quantities

#### 2. Added TP1 Verification for Mirror Account (monitor.py)
- Mirrors the main account verification logic
- Uses mirror-specific order placement functions for corrections
- Tracks mirror position sizes separately
- Triggers mirror-specific rebalancing after TP1 verification
- No user alerts (as per mirror account design)

### Key Code Changes

1. **monitor.py** (lines ~2337-2399): Added TP1 verification for Scenario 1
2. **monitor.py** (lines ~2441-2524): Added TP1 verification for Scenario 2  
3. **monitor.py** (lines ~3089-3193): Added mirror account TP1 verification

### Verification Process

When TP1 is detected as hit:
1. Capture current position size (before)
2. Wait 2 seconds for order execution
3. Capture new position size (after)
4. Calculate actual reduction percentage
5. Compare to expected 85% (with 5% tolerance)
6. If mismatch detected:
   - Calculate additional quantity needed
   - Place corrective market order
   - Alert user of correction
7. Update position tracking with actual values
8. Proceed with rebalancing based on actual position

### Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: Ensures TP1 always closes exactly 85% of position
2. **Reliability**: Automatic correction prevents position/order mismatches
3. **Transparency**: Users are alerted when corrections are made
4. **Consistency**: Both main and mirror accounts stay synchronized

### Testing Recommendations

1. Open a Conservative position
2. Monitor logs when TP1 is hit
3. Verify position reduces by exactly 85%
4. Check that TP2/3/4 are rebalanced to 33.33% each of remaining
5. Confirm mirror account follows same behavior
6. Test corrective orders by simulating partial TP1 fills
