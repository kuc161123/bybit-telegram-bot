# Mirror Position Analysis Summary

## Current Status

### Position Proportions
| Symbol | Main Size | Mirror Size | Actual % | Expected % | Difference |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|------------|
| WIFUSDT | 2019.0 | 663.0 | 32.8% | 50% | -17.2% |
| TIAUSDT | 255.1 | 84.1 | 33.0% | 50% | -17.0% |
| LINKUSDT | 30.9 | 10.2 | 33.0% | 50% | -17.0% |
| DOGEUSDT | 531.0 | 0.0 | 0.0% | 50% | -50.0% |

**Total Value Ratio**: Mirror/Main = 31.8% (Expected: 50%)

## Issues Identified

### 1. ✅ Mirror Monitors Created Successfully
- All mirror positions now have Enhanced TP/SL monitors
- Monitoring loops are running
- Dashboard entries are created

### 2. ❌ Position Size Sync Not Working
**Problem**: When main position increases (limit orders fill), the mirror sync:
- ✅ Calculates correct target size (e.g., 1009.5 for WIFUSDT)
- ✅ Adjusts TP/SL orders to match target size
- ❌ Does NOT place orders to increase mirror position size

**Result**: Mirror TP orders are sized for positions that don't exist yet!

### 3. ❌ Initial Position Opening
**Problem**: Positions appear to be opened at 33% instead of 50%
- This suggests the mirror proportion setting might be 0.33 instead of 0.5
- Or positions were manually opened at wrong size

### 4. ❌ DOGEUSDT Missing
- Main has 531 DOGE
- Mirror has 0 DOGE
- No mirror position was ever opened

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Order Placement**: The sync function adjusts order quantities but doesn't place market orders to increase position size
2. **Wrong Initial Proportion**: Positions opened at 33% suggest configuration issue
3. **Manual Trading Interference**: Some positions may have been opened manually at wrong sizes

## Required Fixes

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Fix Position Size Sync**: Add market order placement to actually increase mirror positions
2. **Verify Mirror Proportion Setting**: Check if it's set to 0.5 (50%)
3. **Open Missing Positions**: Create DOGEUSDT position on mirror
4. **Adjust Existing Positions**: Increase mirror positions to 50% of main

### Code Changes Required:
1. In `sync_position_increase_from_main()`: Add logic to place market orders
2. In `sync_with_main_position_enhanced()`: Add position adjustment orders
3. Add safety checks to prevent over-ordering

## Verification
Run `python check_mirror_position_sizes.py` after fixes to verify:
- All positions at 50% proportion
- Orders match position sizes
- No missing positions
