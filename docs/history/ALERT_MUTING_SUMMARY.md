# Alert Muting Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a system to ensure only the enhanced TP/SL feature sends trading alerts, while muting all other alert sources as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Settings
**File: `config/settings.py`**
- Added `ENHANCED_TP_SL_ALERTS_ONLY = True` setting
- Added individual alert settings for granular control when needed

### 2. Alert Helper Updates
**File: `utils/alert_helpers.py`**
- Modified `send_trade_alert()` to check if alerts are allowed based on caller
- Modified `send_position_closed_summary()` with same checks
- Added `send_simple_alert()` function for enhanced TP/SL system
- Added caller detection using `inspect` module to identify which component is sending alerts

### 3. Enhanced TP/SL Manager Updates
**File: `execution/enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py`**
- Updated to use `send_simple_alert` alias for alerts
- Added limit fill alert functionality with `_send_limit_fill_alert()` method
- Now sends alerts for:
  - Limit order fills
  - TP hits
  - SL hits
  - Position closed
  - Stop loss moved to breakeven

## How It Works

1. **When `ENHANCED_TP_SL_ALERTS_ONLY = True`** (current setting):
   - Only alerts from files containing "enhanced_tp_sl" in their name are allowed
   - All other components (monitor.py, conservative_rebalancer.py, etc.) are blocked
   - The enhanced TP/SL system can send all types of alerts

2. **Alert Types from Enhanced TP/SL**:
   - **Limit Fills**: Notifies when conservative approach limit orders are filled
   - **TP Hits**: Notifies when take profit targets are reached
   - **SL Hits**: Notifies when stop loss is triggered
   - **Breakeven**: Notifies when SL is moved to breakeven
   - **Position Closed**: Summary when position is fully closed

3. **Blocked Alert Sources**:
   - Position monitor (`execution/monitor.py`)
   - Conservative rebalancer
   - Mirror trading alerts
   - Trade execution alerts
   - General position closed summaries from other components

## Testing

To verify the implementation:
1. Run the bot with a new position
2. You should only see alerts from the enhanced TP/SL system
3. No alerts from monitor.py or other components should appear
4. Limit fills, TP hits, and SL hits from enhanced TP/SL should all generate alerts

## Reverting Changes

If you want to re-enable alerts from all components:
1. Set `ENHANCED_TP_SL_ALERTS_ONLY = False` in `config/settings.py`
2. Configure individual components in `ALERT_SETTINGS` dictionary
