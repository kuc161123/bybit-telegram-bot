# Final False TP Fix Complete

## Summary
The false TP detection issue has been successfully resolved. The bot was incorrectly comparing mirror account positions against main account position sizes, causing ~66% false positive detections.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced TP/SL Manager Updates
- Added `get_position_info_for_account` to imports
- Fixed position fetching to be account-aware in key locations:
  - Line ~1010: False positive verification now checks the correct account
  - Additional targeted fixes for limit order detection and position change handling

### 2. Restored Correct Monitor Data
All mirror monitors now have correct position sizes:
- ICPUSDT_Sell_mirror: 24.3 ✓
- IDUSDT_Sell_mirror: 391 ✓
- JUPUSDT_Sell_mirror: 1401 ✓
- TIAUSDT_Buy_mirror: 168.2 ✓
- LINKUSDT_Buy_mirror: 10.2 ✓
- XRPUSDT_Buy_mirror: 87 ✓

### 3. Cleaned Up Environment
- Removed old contaminated backup files
- Created fresh backups with correct data
- Cleared fill tracking data

## Result
The bot is now running without false TP detection errors. Mirror monitors correctly fetch and compare against mirror account positions only.

## Testing Confirmation
When running `python3 main.py`, the bot starts successfully without:
- "Suspicious reduction detected" warnings
- "Detected impossible TP fill" errors
- "Error updating position size" messages

The monitoring system now properly handles the dual account architecture with account-aware position fetching.
