# Monitor Key Collision Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem
The Enhanced TP/SL Manager was using `{SYMBOL}_{SIDE}` as monitor keys, causing collisions when the same position existed on both main and mirror accounts. This resulted in only 7 monitors for 13 positions, leaving 6 main account positions unmonitored.

## Solution Implemented
Changed monitor key format to include account type: `{SYMBOL}_{SIDE}_{ACCOUNT_TYPE}`

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated Monitor Key Format**
   - Old: `XRPUSDT_Buy`
   - New: `XRPUSDT_Buy_main` or `XRPUSDT_Buy_mirror`

2. **Code Updates**
   - `enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py`:
     - Updated `monitor_and_adjust_orders()` to handle new key format
     - Modified monitor creation to use account-aware keys
     - Updated `cleanup_position_orders()` to support both key formats
   - `background_tasks.py`:
     - Updated monitoring loop to pass account_type parameter
   - `trader.py`:
     - Added `account_type="main"` to all `setup_tp_sl_orders()` calls
   - `bybit_helpers.py`:
     - Added `get_position_info_for_account()` helper function

3. **Data Migration**
   - Migrated 7 existing monitors to new key format
   - Created 6 missing main account monitors
   - Total: 13 monitors (7 main + 6 mirror)

## Current Status
✅ All 13 positions have Enhanced TP/SL monitors
✅ No more key collisions
✅ Both accounts can have the same symbol/side
✅ Main account monitors have alerts enabled
✅ Mirror account monitors have alerts disabled

## For Future Positions
YES - All future positions will automatically use the new account-aware key format:
- When you open a position on the main account, it creates a monitor with key `{SYMBOL}_{SIDE}_main`
- When mirror trading creates a position, it creates a monitor with key `{SYMBOL}_{SIDE}_mirror`
- No conflicts even if both accounts have the same position

## Technical Details
The fix ensures:
1. Each account's positions are monitored independently
2. Correct API client is used based on account type
3. Alerts are properly routed (main=enabled, mirror=disabled)
4. Backward compatibility with legacy key format
5. Automatic migration of old monitors
