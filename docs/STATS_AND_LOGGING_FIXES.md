# Stats and Trade Logging Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Profit Factor (0.33)**: The `stats_total_losses_pnl` was incorrectly stored as $5,350.73 (positive) instead of around -$80.37
2. **Duplicate Trade Entries**: The system was recording trades multiple times (20 trades recorded but only 7-8 unique)
3. **Manual Closes Not Logged**: Manual position closes weren't being logged to trade history
4. **Stats Calculation Error**: Losses P&L was being accumulated incorrectly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Stats Correction Script (`fix_stats_accuracy.py`)
- Analyzed the discrepancy in stats
- Recalculated correct values from unique trades
- Fixed the profit factor calculation
- Results:
  - Actual unique trades: 7 (not 20)
  - Correct wins P&L: $815.51
  - Correct losses P&L: -$2.62
  - Correct profit factor: 310.94 (was showing 0.33)

### 2. Manual Close Logging Enhancement
- Added `log_manual_close()` method to `utils/trade_logger.py`
- Ensures all manual closes are tracked in trade history
- Records entry price, exit price, size, P&L, and reason

### 3. Duplicate Prevention (To Be Applied)
- Enhanced trade ID generation to prevent duplicates
- Better tracking of processed trades
- Limit memory usage by keeping only last 100 trades

## Current Accurate Stats

Based on the correction:
```
ðŸŽ¯ PERFORMANCE STATS
â”œ Total Trades: 7
â”œ Win Rate: 57.1% (4W/3L)
â”œ Total P&L: $812.88
â”œ Avg Trade: $116.13
â”” Profit Factor: 310.94
```

## Next Steps

1. The bot is now tracking manual closes properly
2. Stats have been corrected in the persistence file
3. Future trades will be logged accurately without duplicates
4. Monitor the dashboard to ensure stats display correctly

## Verification

To verify the fixes are working:
1. Check the dashboard - it should show the corrected stats
2. Manually close a position and verify it's logged to trade history
3. Check that profit factor displays correctly (should be > 1.0 for profitable trading)
