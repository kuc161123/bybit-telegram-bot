# Fast Approach Order Execution Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The fast approach monitoring was not properly detecting when TP/SL orders were in "Triggered" status, which occurs just before they fill. This could cause the opposite order (SL when TP hits, or TP when SL hits) to not be cancelled properly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Account Monitoring (Already Present)
- ‚úÖ Checks for "Triggered" status in addition to "Filled" and "PartiallyFilled"
- ‚úÖ Waits 0.5 seconds when an order is triggered to allow it to fill
- ‚úÖ Re-checks order status after the wait
- ‚úÖ Only cancels opposite order when primary order is actually filled

### 2. Mirror Account Monitoring (Added)
- ‚úÖ Added fast approach TP/SL monitoring section to mirror monitoring loop
- ‚úÖ Uses the same `check_tp_hit_and_cancel_sl` and `check_sl_hit_and_cancel_tp` functions
- ‚úÖ Passes `None` for ctx_app to prevent duplicate alerts (mirror accounts are silent)
- ‚úÖ Logs all actions with "MIRROR" prefix for clarity

### 3. Enhanced Logging
- Order state transitions are logged with clear messages
- "Triggered" status is specifically called out
- Fill prices and quantities are logged for trade history

### 4. Alert Improvements
- Clear alerts sent when TP/SL hits with details about which orders were cancelled
- Actual fill price used instead of market price in alerts
- P&L calculated based on actual fill data

## Code Changes

### execution/monitor.py
```python
# Added to mirror monitoring loop (around line 2681):
# FIXED: Fast approach TP/SL monitoring for MIRROR account
elif approach == "fast" and current_size > 0:
    
    # Check for TP hit and cancel SL using same function as main account
    if not fast_tp_hit:
        # Pass None for ctx_app to prevent alerts (mirror accounts don't send alerts)
        tp_hit = await check_tp_hit_and_cancel_sl(chat_data, symbol, current_price, side, None)
        if tp_hit:
            fast_tp_hit = True
            logger.info(f"üéØ MIRROR Fast approach TP hit for {symbol} - SL cancelled")
            
    # Check for SL hit and cancel TP using same function as main account
    if not fast_sl_hit:
        # Pass None for ctx_app to prevent alerts (mirror accounts don't send alerts)
        sl_hit = await check_sl_hit_and_cancel_tp(chat_data, symbol, current_price, side, None)
        if sl_hit:
            fast_sl_hit = True
            logger.info(f"üõ°Ô∏è MIRROR Fast approach SL hit for {symbol} - TP cancelled")
```

## Verification

All tests pass:
- ‚úÖ Triggered status handling verified
- ‚úÖ Mirror fast approach handling verified
- ‚úÖ Alert generation working correctly
- ‚úÖ Order flow simulation confirms proper behavior

## Impact

1. **Immediate**: All new fast approach monitors will use the updated logic
2. **Existing Monitors**: Will pick up the changes on their next monitoring cycle (within 10 seconds)
3. **No Manual Intervention Required**: The fix applies automatically to all monitors

## Files Modified

1. `execution/monitor.py` - Added mirror fast approach handling
2. Created backup: `execution/monitor.py.backup_20250628_070825`

## Testing Scripts Created

1. `fix_fast_approach_orders.py` - Initial fix creation script
2. `apply_fast_approach_fix.py` - Automated fix application
3. `manual_fast_approach_fix.py` - Manual patching script
4. `precise_fast_fix.py` - Precise fix application (used)
5. `test_mirror_fix.py` - Mirror logic test
6. `test_fast_approach_complete.py` - Comprehensive test suite
7. `update_active_monitors.py` - Monitor update script

## Result

The fast approach order execution is now properly handling all order states for both main and mirror accounts. The system will:

1. Detect when orders reach "Triggered" status
2. Wait briefly (0.5s) for the order to fill
3. Only cancel the opposite order when the primary order actually fills
4. Send clear alerts about what happened
5. Work identically for both main and mirror accounts
