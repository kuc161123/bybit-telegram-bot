# TP1 Detection and Processing Fix Summary

## Issue Overview
The bot was not properly detecting TP1 (Take Profit 1) hits for conservative approach positions. When TP1 was filled (85% of target position), the following actions were not being triggered:
1. Cancellation of remaining limit orders
2. Movement of Stop Loss to breakeven
3. Proper SL quantity adjustment

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Incorrect TP Detection Logic
The system was using fill percentage relative to the current position to determine which TP was hit:
- TP1 was only recognized when `fill_percentage >= 85%`
- However, when there are unfilled limit orders (e.g., 33% of target), TP1 (85% of target) only fills 28.23% of the actual position
- This caused the system to think a smaller TP was hit

### Problem 2: TP1 Flag Not Set
The `tp1_hit` flag was only set when `fill_percentage >= 85%`, preventing:
- Limit order cancellation (controlled by `CANCEL_LIMITS_ON_TP1` setting)
- SL movement to breakeven
- Proper SL quantity adjustment

### Problem 3: Mirror Account Sync
Mirror accounts didn't have proper TP fill detection, relying only on main account sync.

## Implementation Changes

### Phase 1: Enhanced TP Order Tracking
- TP orders already include `tp_number` field (1-4) and `percentage` field
- No changes needed - existing structure was sufficient

### Phase 2: Added TP Order Identification
- Created `_identify_filled_tp_order()` method to check order history
- Identifies which specific TP order was filled by order ID
- Returns TP number, filled quantity, and percentage

### Phase 3: Updated Conservative Position Handler
- Modified `_handle_conservative_position_change()` to use order-based detection
- Sets `tp1_hit` flag when TP1 specifically is filled (regardless of fill percentage)
- Saves monitor state to persistence after setting flag

### Phase 4: Mirror Account Support
- Updated `_identify_filled_tp_order()` to support mirror accounts
- Modified `_verify_order_fill_history()` to use correct client (main/mirror)
- Ensures mirror positions get same TP1 behavior

### Phase 5: SL Adjustment Logic
- Confirmed `_adjust_sl_quantity()` correctly checks `tp1_hit` flag
- Enhanced SL adjustment also uses the flag properly
- No changes needed - logic was correct

### Phase 6: Enhanced Monitoring
- Added `_send_tp_fill_alert_enhanced()` with specific TP number
- Added detailed logging for TP fill detection
- Improved alerts to show which TP was hit

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. Enhanced TP Fill Detection (`enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py`)
```python
async def _identify_filled_tp_order(self, monitor_data: Dict) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Identify which TP order was filled by checking order history"""
    # Check each TP order's fill status
    # Return TP number and details when found
```

### 2. Updated Conservative Handler
```python
# First check if any TP orders were filled
tp_info = await self._identify_filled_tp_order(monitor_data)
if tp_info:
    tp_number = tp_info["tp_number"]
    # If TP1 was filled, set the tp1_hit flag
    if tp_number == 1 and not monitor_data.get("tp1_hit", False):
        monitor_data["tp1_hit"] = True
        self.save_monitors_to_persistence()
```

### 3. Mirror Account Support
```python
async def _verify_order_fill_history(self, symbol: str, order_id: str, account: str = "main"):
    """Verify order fill with account-specific client"""
    if account == "mirror":
        client = bybit_client_2
    else:
        client = bybit_client
```

## Testing
Created `test_tp1_detection_fix.py` to verify:
1. TP1 detection with partial fill percentages
2. Proper flag setting and persistence
3. Mirror account TP detection
4. SL adjustment behavior

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When TP1 is filled (regardless of fill percentage):
1. ✅ System correctly identifies it as TP1
2. ✅ Sets `tp1_hit` flag to True
3. ✅ Triggers phase transition to PROFIT_TAKING
4. ✅ Cancels remaining limit orders (if `CANCEL_LIMITS_ON_TP1=true`)
5. ✅ Moves SL to breakeven
6. ✅ Sends proper alerts showing "TP1 HIT"
7. ✅ Works for both main and mirror accounts

## Configuration
Ensure these settings in `.env`:
```bash
CANCEL_LIMITS_ON_TP1=true  # Cancel unfilled limit orders when TP1 hits
ENABLE_ENHANCED_TP_SL=true # Use enhanced monitoring system
```
