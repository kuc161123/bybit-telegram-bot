# Limit Order Detection Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
- **Problem**: Limit order fills were not triggering alerts or TP rebalancing
- **Root Cause**: `USE_DIRECT_ORDER_CHECKS=true` was causing early return BEFORE limit order checking code
- **Affected**: Both main and mirror accounts
- **Example**: ZILUSDT had limit fill but no alerts were sent

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Import Error
- Missing import: `get_order_history` was not imported in `enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py`
- This prevented the limit order tracker from functioning

### 2. Code Flow Issue
The monitoring flow was:
```python
def monitor_and_adjust_orders():
    # ... early code ...
    
    if USE_DIRECT_ORDER_CHECKS:
        # Direct monitoring code
        return  # <-- EARLY RETURN HERE!
    
    # Limit order checking code below never executed
    if monitor_data.get("limit_orders"):
        # This code was unreachable!
```

### 3. Case Sensitivity Issue
- Approach comparison was case-sensitive: `== "CONSERVATIVE"`
- Some monitors had lowercase "conservative" causing mismatch

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed Import (line 23-28)
```python
from clients.bybit_helpers import (
    place_order_with_retry, cancel_order_with_retry,
    get_position_info, get_position_info_for_account, get_open_orders, amend_order_with_retry,
    get_correct_position_idx, get_current_price, get_instrument_info, api_call_with_retry,
    get_all_positions, get_order_history  # <-- Added this
)
```

### 2. Moved Limit Order Checking BEFORE Early Return (line 1251-1253)
```python
# ENHANCED: Check and update limit order statuses for better tracking
# This MUST happen before any early returns
if monitor_data.get("limit_orders") and monitor_data.get("approach", "").upper() == "CONSERVATIVE":
    logger.info(f"🔍 Checking limit orders for {monitor_key}: {len(monitor_data.get('limit_orders', []))} orders registered")
    # ... limit order checking logic ...

# AFTER limit checking, then check USE_DIRECT_ORDER_CHECKS
if USE_DIRECT_ORDER_CHECKS:
    # ... direct order checking ...
```

### 3. Fixed Case Sensitivity
- Changed from `== "CONSERVATIVE"` to `.upper() == "CONSERVATIVE"`
- Handles both "conservative" and "Conservative" approaches

## Verification

### Test Scripts Created
1. **`diagnose_trxusdt.py`** - Diagnoses monitor data structure
2. **`trigger_limit_order_check.py`** - Manually triggers limit order checking
3. **`verify_limit_order_fix.py`** - Confirms fix is correctly implemented
4. **`monitor_limit_order_logs.py`** - Real-time log monitoring

### Confirmation
Running `verify_limit_order_fix.py` shows:
```
✅ CONFIRMED: Limit order checking happens BEFORE USE_DIRECT_ORDER_CHECKS
✅ The fix is correctly implemented!
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### When Limit Orders Fill:
1. **Detection**: "🔍 Checking limit orders for..." message in logs
2. **Alert**: "🎯 Limit Order X Filled" notification sent to user
3. **TP Rebalancing**: Automatic adjustment of remaining TPs
4. **Both Accounts**: Works for main and mirror accounts

### Log Messages to Look For:
```
🔍 Checking limit orders for BTCUSDT_Buy_main: 3 orders registered
🔍 Found 3 order IDs to check for limit order status
📊 Checking order abc123 status
✅ Limit order 1 (Limit 1) filled at 45123.5 for position BTCUSDT
🎯 Detected limit fill for BTCUSDT - rebalancing TPs
```

## Important Notes

1. **Checkpoint 10**: Version WITHOUT these fixes (as requested by user)
2. **Focus**: Fix applies to future trades, not retroactively to ZILUSDT
3. **No Impact**: Existing monitoring continues to work normally
4. **Monitoring Interval**: Checks happen every 5 seconds in the background loop

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Logs**: Use `monitor_limit_order_logs.py` to watch for limit order checks
2. **Wait for Fills**: When limit orders fill, alerts should now be sent
3. **Verify Rebalancing**: Check that TPs are adjusted after limit fills
4. **Both Accounts**: Confirm working for both main and mirror positions

## Technical Details

- **File Modified**: `execution/enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py`
- **Line Numbers**: Import at line 28, main fix at lines 1251-1253
- **Approach**: Moved critical code before conditional return
- **Backwards Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
