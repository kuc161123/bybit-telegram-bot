# ZRXUSDT Order Fix Complete Summary

## What Was Done

Since TP1 was already hit for ZRXUSDT, we performed the following fixes:

### 1. Cancelled Limit Entry Orders
- No limit entry orders were found (all orders had `reduceOnly=True`)
- This confirms TP1 was indeed hit and limit orders were already cancelled

### 2. Fixed Stop Loss (SL) Quantities

#### Main Account ✅
- **Before**: SL quantity was 2,546 (way too high for position of 128)
- **After**: SL quantity is now 128 (matches position size)
- Removed duplicate SL orders

#### Mirror Account ✅
- **Before**: SL quantity was 281 (too high for position of 43)
- **After**: SL quantity is now 43 (matches position size)
- Removed duplicate SL orders

### 3. Fixed Mirror Account TP Orders

#### Before:
- All TP orders were "Market" type with trigger prices (stop orders)
- This would have caused them to execute as market orders when triggered

#### After:
- ✅ **TP2**: Limit order at 0.2429 for 14 ZRXUSDT
- ✅ **TP3**: Limit order at 0.2523 for 14 ZRXUSDT  
- ✅ **TP4**: Limit order at 0.2806 for 15 ZRXUSDT
- **Total**: 14 + 14 + 15 = 43 (matches position size exactly)

## Final Status

### Main Account
- **Position**: 128 ZRXUSDT at avg price 0.2286
- **SL**: 1 order at 0.2049 for 128 (✅ Correct)
- **TP Orders**: 3 limit orders (42 each = 126 total) at prices:
  - TP2: 0.2429
  - TP3: 0.2523
  - TP4: 0.2806

### Mirror Account
- **Position**: 43 ZRXUSDT at avg price 0.2286
- **SL**: 1 order at 0.2049 for 43 (✅ Correct)
- **TP Orders**: 3 limit orders totaling 43:
  - TP2: 0.2429 for 14
  - TP3: 0.2523 for 14
  - TP4: 0.2806 for 15

## Scripts Created

1. `analyze_zrxusdt_orders_detailed.py` - Detailed analysis of current orders
2. `fix_zrxusdt_sl_and_tp_final.py` - Initial fix attempt
3. `place_missing_zrxusdt_orders.py` - Placed missing orders
4. `cleanup_zrxusdt_duplicates.py` - Final cleanup of duplicates

## Key Learnings

1. **Order Type for Stop Loss**: Use "Market" with triggerPrice, not "Stop"
2. **Mirror Account Functions**: Use specific mirror functions (cancel_mirror_order, mirror_limit_order)
3. **TP Orders**: Should always be "Limit" type with reduceOnly=True
4. **Position Coverage**: SL should match current position size, not include pending orders after TP1 hits

## Result

✅ All ZRXUSDT orders are now properly configured:
- Stop losses match current position sizes
- All TP orders are limit orders (not stop orders)
- No duplicate orders remain
- Quantities correctly distributed across remaining TPs
