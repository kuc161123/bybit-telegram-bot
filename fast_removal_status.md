# Fast Approach Removal - System State

## Pre-Refactoring Status (2025-07-13 15:37)

### System State
- **Bot Status**: NOT RUNNING (Safe to modify)
- **Active Positions**: 26 monitors detected
- **Pickle File**: Backed up as bybit_bot_dashboard_v4.1_enhanced.pkl.backup_fast_removal_20250713_153748
- **Critical Files**: Backed up in backups/fast_removal_20250713_153748/

### Fast References Found
1. **handlers/__init__.py**: MARGIN_FAST state, fast callback handlers
2. **execution/monitor.py**: Multiple fast defaults, approach branching  
3. **dashboard/generator_v2.py**: Fast counting variables
4. **utils/order_consolidation.py**: Fast pattern mappings (already partially cleaned)
5. **Position analysis JSON files**: Various files with "approach": "fast"

### Current Approach Status
- All monitors in pickle file show "approach": "conservative" ✅
- All trades using conservative TP structure (85/5/5/5) ✅
- No active fast approach trades detected ✅

### Safety Measures
- Bot not running during refactoring
- Complete backups created
- Incremental approach planned
- Rollback capability maintained

This refactoring will ONLY remove unused legacy code without affecting active functionality.
