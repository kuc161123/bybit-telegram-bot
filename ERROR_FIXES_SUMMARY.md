# Enhanced TP/SL Manager Error Fixes Summary

## Fixes Applied - July 17, 2025

### 1. ✅ Fixed API Error: 'str' object has no attribute 'get_positions'
**Issue**: The `get_all_positions()` function was being called with `account_type` (a string) instead of a client object
**Location**: `execution/enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py` line 4961
**Fix**: Added logic to determine the correct client based on account_type before calling the function

### 2. ✅ Fixed Function Signature Mismatch
**Issue**: `_adjust_sl_quantity_enhanced()` was being called with 3 arguments but only accepts 2
**Locations**: Lines 1538 and 1770
**Fix**: Removed the extra argument from the function calls

### 3. ✅ Verified No Monitor Key Mismatches
**Check**: Verified all monitor keys match their account_type values
**Result**: No mismatches found - the error in logs was likely temporary

## Non-Critical Issues (No Action Needed)

### 1. Order Fetch Warnings
- **Status**: Normal behavior
- **Reason**: When limit orders fill, they're no longer in the open orders list
- **Impact**: None - system handles gracefully with warnings

### 2. Position Closure Detection
- **Status**: Working correctly
- **Feature**: Requires 2 consecutive confirmations before stopping monitor
- **Benefit**: Prevents premature monitor termination due to API timeouts

### 3. SL Quantity Adjustment
- **Note**: As mentioned by user, SL covers full position so exact quantity adjustments aren't critical
- **Status**: Fixed the function call issue anyway for code correctness

## Testing Recommendations
1. Monitor logs for absence of API errors after restart
2. Verify limit order fills trigger TP rebalancing correctly
3. Confirm position closure detection still requires 2 confirmations
