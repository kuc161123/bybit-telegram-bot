# Mirror Monitor Issue Summary

## Problem
The bot shows "Monitoring 5 positions" instead of "Monitoring 10 positions" even though:
1. The pickle file contains 10 monitors (5 main + 5 mirror)
2. The mirror account has 5 active positions
3. Mirror trading is enabled

## Root Cause
The Enhanced TP/SL manager's position sync only checks the main account:
- It fetches 5 positions from main account
- It doesn't fetch positions from mirror account
- The monitoring loop only shows monitors that have been synced with positions

## Current State
- ✅ Pickle file has all 10 monitors
- ✅ Mirror positions exist on exchange
- ✅ Mirror trading is enabled
- ❌ Position sync only checks main account
- ❌ Mirror monitors not being loaded into active monitoring

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Restart the Bot (Recommended)
The cleanest solution is to restart the bot after ensuring the fix is in place:
```bash
# Stop the bot (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
python3 main.py
```

### Option 2: Modify Position Sync
The position sync needs to be modified to also check mirror account positions.
This requires changes to `enhanced_tp_sl_manager.py` to sync both accounts.

### Option 3: Force Load on Each Cycle
Use the `ensure_mirror_monitors.py` module to force load all monitors on each cycle.

## Files Created
1. `force_load_mirror_monitors.py` - Forces all monitors into manager
2. `ensure_mirror_monitors.py` - Module to ensure monitors persist
3. Various trigger files to signal reload

## Verification
After fix is applied, you should see:
```
📊 Total positions fetched: 10 across X pages
📊 Found 10 positions to check
🔍 Monitoring 10 positions
```

Instead of current:
```
📊 Total positions fetched: 5 across 2 pages
📊 Found 5 positions to check
🔍 Monitoring 5 positions
```
