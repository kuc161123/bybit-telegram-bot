# Mirror TP Limit Orders Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented changes to ensure all mirror account TP (Take Profit) orders are placed as LIMIT orders, matching the behavior of the main account.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Existing Stop TP Orders
- **Found**: 28 TP orders across 7 positions were incorrectly placed as stop orders (Market orders with trigger prices)
- **Fixed**: All 28 orders converted to limit orders with proper quantities
- **Affected Positions**: CAKEUSDT, CELRUSDT, AUCTIONUSDT, WOOUSDT, 1INCHUSDT, HIGHUSDT, NTRNUSDT

### 2. Mirror TP Order Placement Logic
- **Issue**: `mirror_enhanced_tp_sl.py` was using `orderType: 'Market'` for TP orders
- **Fix**: Changed to `orderType: 'Limit'` with `price` instead of `triggerPrice`

### 3. Mirror Trader TP/SL Function
- **Issue**: `mirror_tp_sl_order()` was placing all orders as stop orders
- **Fix**: Added logic to detect TP orders and route them to `mirror_limit_order()` instead

## Code Changes

### 1. `/execution/mirror_enhanced_tp_sl.py`
```python
# Before:
order_params = {
    'orderType': 'Market',
    'triggerPrice': str(tp_price),
    'triggerDirection': 1 if side == "Buy" else 2,
    'stopOrderType': 'TakeProfit'
}

# After:
order_params = {
    'orderType': 'Limit',
    'price': str(tp_price),
    'reduceOnly': True
}
```

### 2. `/execution/mirror_trader.py`
```python
# Added TP detection logic:
is_tp_order = (stop_order_type == "TakeProfit" or 
              (order_link_id and "TP" in order_link_id.upper()))

if is_tp_order:
    # Route to limit order function
    return await mirror_limit_order(...)
```

## Scripts Created

### 1. `check_all_mirror_tp_orders.py`
- Scans all mirror positions for stop TP orders
- Reports any TP orders that aren't limit orders

### 2. `fix_all_mirror_stop_tp_orders.py`
- Converts existing stop TP orders to limit orders
- Recalculates quantities for proper position coverage

### 3. `verify_mirror_tp_limit_orders.py`
- Verification script to ensure compliance
- Tests order placement logic
- Can be run periodically to verify all TP orders are limit orders

## Verification Results

âœ… All 31 mirror TP orders across 8 positions are now LIMIT orders:
- CAKEUSDT: 4 limit TP orders
- CELRUSDT: 4 limit TP orders
- AUCTIONUSDT: 4 limit TP orders
- WOOUSDT: 4 limit TP orders
- 1INCHUSDT: 4 limit TP orders
- ZRXUSDT: 3 limit TP orders (TP1 already hit)
- HIGHUSDT: 4 limit TP orders
- NTRNUSDT: 4 limit TP orders

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Mirror account now behaves exactly like main account
2. **Better Fills**: Limit orders provide better price control than stop orders
3. **Reduced Slippage**: No market order execution on TP triggers
4. **Proper Order Book Participation**: Limit orders add liquidity instead of taking it

## Future Monitoring

Run the verification script periodically:
```bash
python3 verify_mirror_tp_limit_orders.py
```

This will ensure all new TP orders continue to be placed as limit orders.

## Important Note

SL (Stop Loss) orders continue to be placed as stop orders (Market with trigger price), which is the correct behavior. Only TP orders are placed as limit orders.
