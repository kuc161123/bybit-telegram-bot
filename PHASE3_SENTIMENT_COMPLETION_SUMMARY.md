async with sentiment_aggregator as aggregator:
    sentiment = await aggregator.get_aggregated_sentiment("BTCUSDT")
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment.overall_label} ({sentiment.overall_score}/100)")
```

### Enhanced Market Status
```python
from market_analysis.market_status_engine_enhanced import enhanced_market_status_engine

status = await enhanced_market_status_engine.get_enhanced_market_status("BTCUSDT")
summary = enhanced_market_status_engine.get_enhanced_market_status_summary(status)
```
