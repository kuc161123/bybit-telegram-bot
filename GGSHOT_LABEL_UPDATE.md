# GGShot Label-Based Detection Update

## Key Discovery

The GGShot screenshots include **text labels** that clearly identify each price type:

### Labels to Look For:
1. **Entry Prices**: `"add short"` or `"add long"`
2. **Take Profit Prices**: `"GG-Shot:Take Profit"`
3. **Stop Loss Price**: `"GG-Shot:Trailing Stop Loss"`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated All Prompts
All OCR prompts now specifically look for these text labels as the PRIMARY method of identifying price types:

```
üìù TEXT LABELS (MOST IMPORTANT):
- "add short" or "add long" = ENTRY PRICES
- "GG-Shot:Take Profit" = TAKE PROFIT PRICES
- "GG-Shot:Trailing Stop Loss" = STOP LOSS PRICE
```

### 2. Enhanced Parsing Logic
The parsing now:
1. First looks for the text labels
2. Uses colored boxes as secondary confirmation
3. Properly sorts based on label type and trade direction

### 3. For SHORT Trades
- **Entries** (with "add short" label): Sorted lowest ‚Üí highest
  - Primary Entry: LOWEST value
  - Limit 1: Next higher
  - Limit 2: Highest entry
- **TPs** (with "GG-Shot:Take Profit" label): Sorted highest ‚Üí lowest
  - TP1: HIGHEST TP value
  - TP2: Next lower
  - TP3: Next lower
  - TP4: LOWEST TP value
- **SL** (with "GG-Shot:Trailing Stop Loss" label): Single value at TOP

### 4. For LONG Trades
- **Entries** (with "add long" label): Sorted highest ‚Üí lowest
  - Primary Entry: HIGHEST value
  - Limit 1: Next lower
  - Limit 2: Lowest entry
- **TPs** (with "GG-Shot:Take Profit" label): Sorted lowest ‚Üí highest
  - TP1: LOWEST TP value
  - TP2: Next higher
  - TP3: Next higher
  - TP4: HIGHEST TP value
- **SL** (with "GG-Shot:Trailing Stop Loss" label): Single value at BOTTOM

## How It Works Now

1. OCR looks for text labels first
2. Identifies prices based on their labels
3. Confirms with colored boxes (red/grey)
4. Sorts appropriately for trade direction
5. Returns properly ordered parameters

## Expected Improvement

With these label-based identifications, the system should now:
- ‚úÖ Correctly identify which prices are entries vs TPs
- ‚úÖ Properly order them for both LONG and SHORT trades
- ‚úÖ Avoid confusion between similar values
- ‚úÖ Have much higher accuracy

## Testing

Try your screenshot again. The system will now look for:
- "add short" labels next to entry prices
- "GG-Shot:Take Profit" labels next to TP prices
- "GG-Shot:Trailing Stop Loss" label next to stop loss

This should dramatically improve extraction accuracy!
