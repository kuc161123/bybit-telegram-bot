# ZRXUSDT TP1 Simulation Summary

## What Was Done

I've created a simulation that marks ZRXUSDT as having its TP1 hit with the following changes applied:

### Changes Applied to ZRXUSDT Position:
1. **TP1 Hit Flag**: Set `tp1_hit = True`
2. **Phase**: Changed to `PROFIT_TAKING` 
3. **Limit Orders**: Marked as cancelled (`limit_orders_cancelled = True`)
4. **SL Status**: Marked as moved to breakeven (`sl_moved_to_be = True`)

### Files Created:
1. `simulate_zrxusdt_tp1_hit.py` - Comprehensive simulation script
2. `force_zrxusdt_tp1_hit.py` - Direct pickle modification script
3. `trigger_monitor_reload_now.py` - Monitor reload trigger

## Current Status

✅ **Changes Saved**: The TP1 hit status has been saved to the pickle file
✅ **Monitor Created**: A ZRXUSDT_Buy monitor with TP1 hit status exists in persistence
⚠️ **Bot Memory**: The running bot hasn't loaded these changes yet

## How to Apply the Changes

Since the bot is currently running with monitors in memory, you have two options:

### Option 1: Restart the Bot (Recommended)
```bash
# Stop the bot
pkill -f "python.*main.py"

# Wait a moment
sleep 5

# Start the bot again
cd ~/bybit-telegram-bot
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

When the bot restarts, it will:
- Load the ZRXUSDT monitor with TP1 already hit
- Skip limit order cancellation (already marked as done)
- Skip SL breakeven movement (already marked as done)
- Continue monitoring with TP1 behaviors active

### Option 2: Wait for Natural Reload
The bot may eventually reload monitors from persistence, but this is not guaranteed without a restart.

## What the Simulation Achieves

The simulation effectively puts ZRXUSDT in the same state it would be after a real TP1 hit:

1. **Position State**: In profit-taking phase
2. **Orders**: Limit orders marked as cancelled
3. **Stop Loss**: Marked as at breakeven
4. **Future Behavior**: 
   - No more limit order cancellation attempts
   - SL quantity adjustments based on remaining position
   - Ready for TP2/TP3/TP4 fills

## Verification

After restarting the bot, look for these indicators in the logs:
- `Found 1 persisted monitors` (including ZRXUSDT_Buy)
- No attempts to cancel limit orders for ZRXUSDT
- No attempts to move SL to breakeven for ZRXUSDT
- Position monitoring continues normally

## Note on Mirror Account

The simulation was designed to handle both main and mirror accounts. Since ZRXUSDT appears to be on the main account only, the mirror account simulation was skipped.
