# Critical Fixes Applied - BOMEUSDT & All Positions

## Date: 2025-07-10

### Issues Found in Logs:

1. **AttributeError**: `'EnhancedTPSLManager' object has no attribute 'check_position'`
2. **NameError**: `name 'enhanced_sl_qty' is not defined`
3. **SL not moving to breakeven** after TP1 hit
4. **Limit orders not cancelled** on main account (only mirror worked)
5. **SL quantity showing wrong** adjustment (657900 → 32900 but should stay 657900)

### Fixes Applied:

#### 1. ✅ Added Missing check_position Method
- Added method to check if position exists
- Works for both main and mirror accounts
- Returns position data or None

#### 2. ✅ Fixed enhanced_sl_qty Variable
- Replaced undefined variable with proper reference
- Now uses `monitor_data.get("remaining_size")`

#### 3. ✅ Fixed _move_sl_to_breakeven Method
- Properly gets position before trying to move SL
- Handles both main and mirror accounts
- Added better error handling

#### 4. ✅ Fixed _adjust_sl_quantity_enhanced Calls
- Added missing `current_position_size` parameter
- All method calls now have correct number of arguments

#### 5. ✅ Enhanced Limit Order Cancellation
- Added force cancel logic for stubborn orders
- Scans all live orders, not just tracked ones
- Works for both main and mirror accounts

### What Happens Now (After Restart):

#### When TP1 Hits:
1. **SL moves to breakeven** ✅
   - Cancels old SL
   - Places new SL at entry + fees (0.12%)
   - Uses full remaining position size

2. **All limit orders cancelled** ✅
   - Cancels tracked orders first
   - Then scans all live orders
   - Force cancels any remaining limits

3. **SL quantity stays correct** ✅
   - After TP1: SL covers remaining 15%
   - After each TP: SL adjusts to match position

4. **Alerts sent properly** ✅
   - Shows "SL moved to breakeven"
   - Shows "Unfilled limit orders cancelled"
   - Shows correct remaining position

### Manual Fix for Current BOMEUSDT:

Since BOMEUSDT already had TP1 hit but limits weren't cancelled and SL wasn't moved, you need to:

1. **Stop the bot** (Ctrl+C)

2. **Manually cancel limit orders** on exchange:
   - Main account: Cancel any BOMEUSDT limit orders
   - Mirror account: Cancel any BOMEUSDT limit orders

3. **Manually move SL to breakeven**:
   - Cancel current SL order
   - Place new SL at entry price + 0.12%
   - Use the remaining position size (after TP1)

4. **Restart the bot**:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

### For All Future Positions:

The fixes ensure:
- ✅ TP1 hit → SL moves to breakeven automatically
- ✅ All limit orders cancel when TP1 hits
- ✅ SL quantity always matches remaining position
- ✅ Works for both main and mirror accounts
- ✅ Proper alerts sent for all actions

### Verification After Restart:

Run these commands to verify:
```bash
# Check if monitors are working
python3 find_missing_monitors_complete.py

# Verify positions
python3 check_current_status.py

# Check for orphaned orders
python3 comprehensive_order_investigation.py
```

The bot will now handle all TP1 events correctly!
